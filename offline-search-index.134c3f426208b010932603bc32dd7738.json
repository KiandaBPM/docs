Understanding Controls In Kianda, controls are the building blocks of your forms. They allow you to capture user inputs, organize the layout, perform actions, and even create custom functionality.\nControls are grouped into four main categories: Input, Layout, Actions, and Custom. Each category serves a distinct purpose, helping you create interactive and responsive forms tailored to your business needs. The table below lists the controls available under each category.\n   Input Controls Layout Controls Action Controls Custom Controls     Text Box Panel Button Custom controls created using HTML, Handlebars, and JavaScript   List (Dropdown, Radio Button, Multi-select, Checkbox) Dialog Box Link    Number Rich Text     Date Field Group     File      Table      User Picker      Toggle      Signature Pad       4. Adding Controls to a Form Adding controls to a form in Kianda is a straightforward process. Once you have accessed the form builder, you can drag and drop the desired controls from the control panel onto your form canvas.\nEach control can be customized through its properties, which are displayed on the right side of the screen. You can configure settings such as visibility, required fields, responsiveness, and more. This intuitive interface allows you to quickly build and modify forms to suit your specific needs, ensuring an efficient and user-friendly experience for end-users.\nYour browser does not support the video tag.   5. Making Forms Mobile Responsive Ensuring that your forms are mobile responsive is essential for providing a seamless user experience across different devices. Kianda’s form builder allows you to design forms that automatically adjust to various screen sizes, from desktops to tablets and smartphones. Using the responsive layout options available in the form builder, you can define how each control should behave on different devices. This ensures that your forms remain accessible and user-friendly, regardless of the screen size.\nTo make a form mobile responsive, start by configuring the layout settings of each control. In the properties panel, you can specify the number of columns a control should span on different screen sizes, following the Bootstrap grid system.\nFor example, you might set a text box to take up half the width of the screen on a desktop (6 columns) but adjust it to full width (12 columns) on a mobile device. This flexibility allows you to optimize the layout for better readability and ease of use on smaller screens.\nAdditionally, you can group controls using layout elements like panels and field groups to maintain a clean and organized structure. These grouping elements can also be configured for responsiveness, ensuring that related controls stay together and display cohesively on all devices. By leveraging Kianda’s responsive design features, you can create forms that provide a consistent and efficient user experience, enhancing usability and satisfaction for both desktop and mobile users.\n6.

AD is a logical and hierarchical structured data store of objects which are mostly accounts. Accounts such as Users, Computers, Groups and other objects such as Printers or Group Policy Objects (GPO). For example, you can store information about user accounts within an AD such as Name, Email, Manager name, Password, Job title and Permissions.\nThe Kianda AD connector uses Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) allowing users to query Active Directory libraries for example to retrieve properties for users. For more information on LDAP go to https://ldap.com/ or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol.\nWhen to use Having an AD connector will allow you to access and update information that is stored in your AD database from your Kianda subscription. You will be able to use User-related AD functions which will allow you to use the connector when manipulating users within your AD. For example creating users, updating their permissions, moving them between groups or removing them from the directory. To use the AD functions, you can use the Data rules that are predefined within Kianda.\nBefore you get started Before you can create a connection with your Active Directory and your Kianda subscription, you need to\na) download Kianda Cloud Connect\nb) create a specific user for the connector, defined in your Active directory database\nKianda Cloud Connect Kianda Cloud Connect is a piece of software that establishes a connection between your local machine and your Kianda subscription. This lightweight app will sit on your PC or server where files reside that you need to use in Kianda processes, and therefore is an on premise function .\nKianda Cloud Connect allows data to travel from your local machine to the Kianda Cloud Connect service, and then the Kianda Cloud Connect service sends data to your Kianda subscription. This data transfer works both ways depending on what operation you are performing for example Deleting a file or Creating one.\nUser account for the connection You must create an account in your AD service which will serve as the connector administration account for the data connector, and this account must be a global administrator in order to allow access to functions.\nthis account must correspond. Note that this account can only be used to manage the connector for one subscription and cannot be used in more than one Kianda subscriptions as Kianda Cloud Connect will not be able to tell which subscription you want to connect to.\nTo learn more about how to download and create a connection between your Kianda subscription and Kianda Cloud Connect go to Kianda Cloud Connect.\nHow to get started   From the Kianda home page, click on Administration \u003e Data sources.\n  Click on + Add new button and choose Active Directory from the list of data sources provided.\n  You will be automatically brought to the Active Directory details page, where you can start setting up the connection.\nChoose from the edit options:\n Display name - type in the name for your PowerShell connector. The display name is used to identify your connector. Directory path - enter in the path to the directory. The path must be LDAP or GC (Global Connector). AD User - enter in the domain and user that you want to connect to. To specify the domain and user correctly use the following format: \u003cdomain\u003e/\u003cusername\u003e Password - enter in the password used to login for the desired user. Use Kianda Cloud Connect - by default this option is enabled, the cloud connect is used to create a connection between the Active Directory connector and Kianda itself. To learn more about Kianda Cloud Connect and how to create a connection between Kianda and your PC, go to Kianda Cloud Connect.  Connectors - displays all available connector PC’s that have a connection established with your Kianda subscription. This option is used to select the PC connection that is running the Active Directory server.   Status - represents the current status of the connection.  incomplete - means that the details of the connector were not fully completed. test failed - means that the details of the connector are incorrect and the connection has failed. ready - means that the connector has successfully connected and its ready to be used.    Here is an example of a completed AD connector page, where the directory path is LDAP and this connector is connecting to LAB2 where the AD database resides.\n  When you have added the necessary details, you are ready to test your connection and add security. At the bottom of the PowerShell Connector page, click on Test connection button and if the service has been correctly configured, then you should receive a notification saying Connection test succeeded.\n  Click on Save to save the connection and you will receive a notification saying Details saved successfully.\n  Add Security settings by clicking on the Security button, go to Setting security for data sources for more details.\n  Click on Close to close the details page and return to the data source management main view.\n  Active Directory Remote Procedures Active Directory functions are User-related remote procedures and to use them you have to use the Data rules that are predefined within Kianda. The remote procedures that are available are listed below. To give you an idea of how they work, some of these procedures are detailed on other pages, click on the links below to find out more.\n FindUsers - allows you to look for a user within your directory by defining a user attribute as a means of searching for them. IsMemberOf - allows you to see if a user is a member of a group. You need to specify both a user and a group. CreateUser - allows you to create a user within your directory. You need to specify a username, first name, last name, email and password to create a user successfully. UpdateUser - allows you to update user attributes. You need to specify what user to update by providing their sAMAccountName and distinguishedName (DN). AddUserToGroup - allows you to add a user to a group by providing the group name and both the distinguishedName and sAMAccountName of the user. RemoveUserFromGroup - allows you to remove a user from a group by providing the group name and both the distinguishedName and sAMAccountName of the user. Enable User - allows you to enable or disable a user by providing the enable parameter and both the distinguishedName and sAMAccountName of the user. The enable parameter is either true or false. MoveUser - allows you to move a user to a specific path in your directory by providing the destination path and both the distinguishedName and sAMAccountName of the user.  Create User Function example Lets take the CreateUser function as an example to show how these functions work. As mentioned earlier, we need to use the Data rules to use these functions and for this example we use the Create item rule which is available from the Data rules.\n  When creating a user in Active Directory, there are some required properties that we need to provide. Those properties are a username, givenName (first name), surname (last name), email and password. There are also extra properties that can be provided by expanding a properties tab within the function:\n  We need to create at least five fields that will be used to provide a value as the required properties. We will use a text box field for each one:\n  Use the create item rule to use the function. We need to map the text box fields to the appropriate properties as follow:\n  You can apply the create item rule to a button, for example, the submit button. This will result in a user being created in your AD whenever the submit button will be clicked.\nAD Use case example - User synchronisation Using AD you can perform user synchronisation for user groups in Kianda. For example by creating a specific group in Kianda, we can allow Group member synchronisation for that group, by choosing the option shown in the image below with, using the AD data connector. See Groups for more details on group creation.\nIn the example above, the Kianda environment is synchronised with AD, so that any users added to or deleted from the AD database will be added to or removed from the users of the group ‘Company Users’. This kind of user synchronisation is also possible with Office 365, SharePoint as well as AD.\nBy clicking on the Filter button within Groups, an LDAP Filter can be applied. The LDAP filter is an open format that allows you to perform queries with AD. For example the query below is used to query for users in the IT department with an account that is not disabled (=2).\nLDAP queries and more information on LDAP can be found in many pages such as:\nhttps://ldap.com/ldap-filters/\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/ldap/ldap-reference\n","categories":"","description":"Kianda Active Directory Connector","excerpt":"Kianda Active Directory Connector","ref":"/platform/connectors/active-directory/","tags":"","title":"Active Directory Connector"},{"body":"The Find Users remote procedure allows you to look for a user within your directory by defining a user attribute as a means of searching for them.\nWhen to use Having an AD connector will allow you to access information that is stored within your Kianda subscription.

The functions that are available are:\n FindUsers - allows you to look for a user within your directory by defining a user attribute as a means of searching for them. IsMemberOf - allows you to see if a user is a member of a group. You need to specify both a user and a group. CreateUser - allows you to create a user within your directory. You need to specify a username, first name, last name, email and password to create a user successfully. UpdateUser - allows you to update user attributes. You need to specify what user to update by providing their sAMAccountName and distinguishedName (DN). AddUserToGroup - allows you to add a user to a group by providing the group name and both the distinguishedName and sAMAccountName of the user. RemoveUserFromGroup - allows you to remove a user from a group by providing the group name and both the distinguishedName and sAMAccountName of the user. Enable User - allows you to enable or disable a user by providing the enable parameter and both the distinguishedName and sAMAccountName of the user. The enable parameter is either true or false. MoveUser - allows you to move a user to a specific path in your directory by providing the destination path and both the distinguishedName and sAMAccountName of the user.  Lets take the CreateUser function as an example to show how these functions work. As mentioned earlier, we need to use the Data rules to use these functions and for this example we use the Create item rule which is available from the Data rules.\n  When creating a user in Active Directory, there are some required properties that we need to provide. Those properties are a username, givenName (first name), surname (last name), email and password. There are also extra properties that can be provided by expanding a properties tab within the function:\n  We need to create at least five fields that will be used to provide a value as the required properties. We will use a text box field for each one:\n  Use the create item rule to use the function. We need to map the text box fields to the appropriate properties as follow:\n  You can apply the create item rule to a button, for example, the submit button. This will result in a user being created in your AD whenever the submit button will be clicked.\nWhat’s next  Your Active Directory connector is now set up and ready to be used in your processes. To find out more about how to design processes go to Designer.\n","categories":"","description":"Kianda Active Directory Connector - permissions","excerpt":"Kianda Active Directory Connector - permissions","ref":"/platform/connectors/active-directory/is-member-of/","tags":"","title":"Active Directory Connectors - Permissions"},{"body":"Introduction The Add time to date rule allows you to add time to a date field in order to have a future date set within your form. This rule can remind users through set intervals to complete a process instance before a set time. An example of this rule would be entering a numeric value of 1 into the Time to add or a field, selecting Days from the Time unit drop-down list, and selecting Today() from the To date radio button options.\nWhen to use The Add time to date rule should be used when a user wishes to add time to a date. For example, sending a reminder email after a set interval of time.\nYou can add this rule:\n to a field to a form to a process (the rule will run on load)  Before you get started In advance of using this rule, you need to have created one or more forms, complete with control fields. For example, you must have a created field in your form that the Add time to date rule can be applied to. See Date control for more information on using date fields.\nHow to get started   Click on an existing process by going to Administration \u003e Designer and decide which form, or field you will apply the rule to, by clicking on that item so that it is in edit mode so you can see the Edit/pen button, Pen button .\n  Click on Add a rule \u003e Dates \u003e Add time to date.\n  In the Edit rule - Add time to date dialog box, give the rule a title in the Title field.\n  If you want to add conditions for the rule, click on the Edit conditions button . See Conditions for more details.\n  Under Action create one or more actions for the rule by filling out the following:\n  Time to add or a field - click on the field and select a numerical value, or another field in your Kianda form. This will be the interval quantity.\n  Time unit - choose an option from the drop-down list to serve as your interval unit:\n  Minutes\n  Hours\n  Days\n  Weeks\n  Months\n  Years\n    To date - choose from the radio buttons:\n  Now() - adding time to date immediately\n  Today() - adding time to date from midnight today\n  Date field - adding time to date from the date specified in another field\n    Destination date field - choose the date field within your form which this new date is to be stored. If the Use business hours? checkbox is ticked, you will be prompted to enter the start and end time of your business’ working day, using the time picker list. It should be noted that this checkbox only appears when the time unit chosen is minutes or hours.\n  Date calculation settings - you can select whether the time added to your chosen date field:\n Includes weekends Excludes weekends Excludes weekends and special dates Excludes special dates    Special dates - you can also define custom special dates and save them accordingly. Click on Add special date to add in a date. Enter a label for this special date in the left field and a date in the right field. By choosing a title for a new special date, and entering the date into the date field, the date can be saved using the Save special dates for reuse button . To load previously saved dates, click on the Load special dates button . You can delete a saved Special date by clicking on the Bin/Trash button.\n    Finally, clicking on the OK button will save the new rule you have just created and apply it to the chosen field.\n  Editing, deleting or duplicating rules When you have clicked on an existing rule, and the rule is visible in the right-hand pane under Rules, there are a number of options available to you.\n To disable a rule click the slider across beside the rule name. To copy a rule, click on the Duplicate button beside the rule name. To delete a rule, click on the Bin/Trash button . To view a rule, click on the rule name to open the Edit rule dialog box.  User tip  Multiple Special dates can be loaded at once to allow you to select a number of specific dates to exclude from the rule.\nThe Add time to date rule is commonly used with the Schedule a rule rule to apply the specified time to a rule on a button, for example. This can be used like a clock to countdown to an event such as sending a reminder email.\nWhat’s next  To find out more about other date rules go to Dates.\nTo find out more about other rules go to Rules.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Introduction The Add time to date rule allows you to add time to a …","ref":"/platform/rules/dates/add-time-to-date/","tags":"","title":"Add time to date"},{"body":"Conditions are a key component of Kianda rules. They are the triggers that result in fully dynamic forms. Conditions enable you to create natural language conditions when rules should be triggered.\nThe Conditions button is found within all rules as well as dashboard widgets. Conditions can also be set when setting data source security levels for B2B portals.\nConditions add an important level of interactivity, creating dynamic pathways within a process. These pathways could result from user interaction or from other events that happen.\nConditions work on the ‘if…then’ principle: ‘if’ the condition exists ‘then’ an action happens, and where applicable, if the condition does not exist, then another action can happen. You can use these principles as steps to implementing conditions:\n Create the condition(s) Create the action(s) that will be applied as a result of the first condition being in place. Where applicable, create the otherwise action(s) based on other conditions being in place.  Create the condition   To create conditions, first choose the process element you want the condition to apply to – such as a form, set of forms, a field/control or set of fields. This could also be a set of common fields associated with all process instances, such as Process ID, Status or Modified by, see image below.\n  Next, depending on whether the rule is applied to text-based fields, date fields or user picker fields, choose from 13 text operators, 25 date operators and one additional user picker operator, as shown in the image below.\n  Then choose a value, this could be typed in text, number(s), date(s), form(s) or field(s).\n  Condition elements\nIn the case of multiple conditions, you can use And or Or to create a group of compound conditions:\nThe result is a flexible process workflow that will result in desired actions based on any number of conditions.\nRule action(s) – example Hide or Disable rule To create actions and where applicable, otherwise actions, the action will depend on the rule that is chosen. All Kianda rules use a natural language structure to make it is easy to apply actions. For example, for the Workflow rule, Hide or Disable, you can choose forms and fields from your process and then apply seven possible actions (as shown below).\nAction elements for Hide or Disable\nThe actions within Hide or disable are:\n Hide will hide a process element (forms or fields) from view. Show will show the element. Disable blocks a user from editing an element. Enable allows a user to add a value to an element. Toggle visible will toggle between showing an element or not, based on subsequent clicks of a field that the rule is applied to. Toggle enable will toggle between allowing an element to be edited or not, based on subsequent clicks of a field that the rule is applied to. Hide and clear will allow you to hide a process element and clear the details. For example, if a toggle button has this rule applied, with an otherwise action of show on a textbox, then if one value is chosen on the toggle button, the user is allowed enter details into the textbox. The otherwise action is that the field is hidden and cleared of data, so that no data can be retrieved. This might be useful, for example, when sensitive information is used, like a social security number on a form.  Note: You can use rules to create actions without conditions too. In this case the rule will simply execute, for example when a form or field is clicked on.\nWhat’s next  Depending on how the rule is applied, for example to a Submit button, the rule order is important to consider, see Multiple rules.\nTo find out more about rule implementation, go to the main Rules page and then click on the links to the different rule categories.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Conditions are a key component of Kianda rules.

This framework uses industry-standard protocol for authorisation focusing on simplifying client developer practices, and at the same time providing specific authorisation flows for applications. The OAuth 2.0 framework uses Bearer type tokens to authorise access to the platform for individual users. This type of token is required by Kianda to perform any Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) requests to external Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).\nWhen working within Kianda, there is no need for the Bearer token when making API requests during widget, rule or field creation because the Bearer token is already retrieved as part of a user login. If you may want to create an application outside of Kianda however, this Bearer token needs to be provided for any CRUD operations to the API. There are two methods to retrieve the Bearer token:\n Using a POST request Using DevTools  Click on the links above to go the the relevant sections.\nRetrieving Bearer token using a POST request You can retrieve a bearer token using a POST request where the content body type is is set to application, x-www-form-urlencoded.\nThe request will look like https://domain.com/token where the domain is your company, for example https://green-itr.kianda.com/token . For the request to be valid, you need to pass the following form parameters to the body of the request:\n   Parameter Value     username: your Kianda username   password: your Kianda password   scope: your Kianda subscription ID   grant_type: password    The Response Body will be as follows:\n{  \"access_token\": \"\u003cBearer access_token\",  \"token_type\": \"bearer\",  \"expires_in\": 299,  \"userName\": \"\u003cProvided username\u003e\",  \"userId\": \"\u003cApplication userId\u003e\",  \"subscriptionId\": \"\u003cSubscriptionID\u003e\",  \"securityStamp\": \"\u003cToken Security token (Guid)\u003e\",  \"hostURL\": \"\u003cYour kianda domain\u003e\",  \".issued\": \"\u003cToken Issued Date and time\u003e\",  \".expires\": \"\u003cToken Issued Date and time\u003e\" } You can obtain the scope value by going to Administration \u003e Subscription \u003e Subscription Details \u003e Subscription Id.\nRetrieving Bearer token using DevTools You can retrieve your Bearer token using Chrome DevTools, making sure you are logged into Kianda. When logged in, open Chrome DevTools by:\n Right clicking your mouse anywhere on the screen. Click on Inspect in the dialog box. Open the Network tab. Click on the info request. In the Header tab, scroll down to authorisation. You can find your Bearer token here.

AD is a logical and hierarchical structured data store of objects which are mostly accounts. Accounts such as Users, Computers, Groups and other objects such as Printers or Group Policy Objects (GPO). For example, you can store information about user accounts within an AD such as Name, Password, Job title and Permissions.\nHaving an AD connector will allow you to access information that is stored there within your Kianda subscription. You will be able to use User related AD functions which will allow you to use the connector when manipulating users within your AD. For example creating users, updating their permissions, moving them between groups or removing them from the directory. To use the AD functions, you can use the Data rules that are predefined within Kianda.\nBefore you get started Before you can create a connection with your Active Directory and your Kianda subscription, you need to download Kianda Cloud Connect. Kianda Cloud Connect is a piece of software that establishes a connection between your local machine and your Kianda subscription. This lightweight app will sit on your PC or server where files reside that you need to use in Kianda processes. It allows the data to travel from your local machine to the Kianda Cloud Connect service, and then the Kianda Cloud Connect service sends data to your Kianda subscription. This data transfer works both ways depending on what operation you are performing for example Deleting a file or Creating one.\nTo learn more about how to download and create a connection between your Kianda subscription and Kianda Cloud Connect go to Kianda Cloud Connect.\nHow to get started   From the Kianda home page, click on Administration \u003e Data sources.\n  Click on + Add new button and choose Active Directory from the list of data sources provided.\n  You will be automatically brought to the Active Directory details page, where you can start setting up the connection.\nChoose from the edit options:\n Display name - type in the name for your PowerShell connector.

Title - The Title of the field, in this case ‘Date’. Show title - If this is selected, the Date field title will be shown in the form. Required - If this is selected, the Date field will be mandatory for the form user. Enabled - If this is selected, the user will be able to edit or interact with the field. Visible - If this is selected, the Date field will be visible in the form. Layout - The width of the blue bar can be adjusted to change the width of the Date field as it appears on a PC or mobile phone (to view the Mobile layout, click on the expand button to the right).  To learn more about the different options within the Field properties menu, go to Field Properties.\nSaving changes and version history Make sure to save any changes you make by clicking on the Save button . You will always have the option to revert back to previous versions of your form by clicking the Design Version History button in the top right corner.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Date controls or Date fields can be inserted in a form when you want a …","ref":"/platform/controls/input/date/","tags":"","title":"Date control"},{"body":"The process designer provides an intuitive interface where you can quickly start building a process app together with forms, fields and rules for any business use case. Forms are an important component of any process. They might be used as a stage of a process and can be made active individually or at the same time (parallel forms).\nA process design is a JSON document that encapsulate the visual layout and logic that renders into a fully functional process app and allows users to perform all sort of tasks. The process designer allows process designers to easily compose the process JSON schema without ever requiring the user to write a single line of code.\nDesigner introduction This video introduces the process designer and demonstrates how to start creating a form and add fields to a process.\nYour browser does not support the video tag.   Preview a process As an Administrator or someone with the role Design business process, you can preview your process designs at any time using the Run and preview process button . This is a useful feature that allows you to preview your process, and visualise the logical flow of your design without publishing it yet for your users to view/use. Within the preview window, you can also troubleshoot your fields, rules and conditions by utilising the rule debugger feature.\nHow to launch the process preview   Navigate to the left-hand pane of the designer screen and click on the Run and preview process button . From here, your process will display in a preview window only to you or to other Process/workspace security users that have access to the design.\n  Within the process preview window, you can interact with controls and enter information as expected and the rules will execute on fields/buttons - the window displaying as a process instance, similar to when it will when published.\n  You can utilise the Rule debugger feature for troubleshooting purposes by clicking on the Enable / Disable Rule debugging button in the top right corner of the window.\n  You can preview the process design from the perspective of different devices by clicking on the Device preview buttons to the right of the Rule debugger button. This feature will visualise how your process design is dynamic and responsive on a myriad of devices. The options for device emulation are as follows:\n  Desktop preview - displays the process instance as it would look on a desktop device.\n  Tablet preview - displays the process instance as it would look on a tablet device.\n  Mobile preview - displays the process instance as it would look on a mobile device.\n  Note: If you select Tablet preview or Mobile preview, a Rotate device button will appear in the top right-hand corner. Clicking on this button will rotate the device screen from portrait to landscape and vice versa in the preview window.\n  When you are finished previewing your process design, click on the Exit preview mode button in the top right-hand corner of the previewer window.\n  Add new forms Add new forms by clicking the add form button on the top of the designer screen. Options will be displayed to allow you to configure how the form should work.\nEditing forms Click on the form tab on top of the designer to reveal the form edit button (pencil) clicking this button will open the form editor and reveal its properties.\nImport forms Within the process designer you can import forms and other fields from other process designs within your workspace. Click the import button to the top right of the process designer to import parts of other process designs into your process.\nProperties pane In addition to adding fields/controls and rules, there are a number of ways to create the form and process design you want. You can set properties at property, form and field level. Properties represent how an element presents itself, for example the title and layout of the element.\nProperties at all levels are visible in the right-hand pane of Kianda designer, along with the:\n  Import button to allow you to import forms and form elements like fields\n  Version history button to allow you to manage version of the process design\n  Settings button to allow you to apply process security settings amongst other options\n  Process level properties When you click on a process from the main process view, straight away you will see the Process properties in the right-hand pane as shown in the image above. To find out more about process go to the Process properties page.\nWhen you click on a form within a process, then the properties view changes to show Form properties, as shown in the image in Form level properties.\nIf you want to return to Process properties, click on the process name beside the Designer and chevron symbol, that is:\nForm level properties When you click on a form in Kianda Designer, the properties for that form appear.\nTo find out more about form properties go to the Form properties page.\nNote that at form level, additional buttons appear above Form properties namely:\n  Edit/Pen button where clicking on this button opens the Edit dialog box for the chosen item, for example a form.\n  Clone button that allows you to make a duplicate form. Click on OK to make a copy or Close to close the dialog box and cancel the copy.\n  Bin/trash button where clicking on this button opens a popup asking you to confirm that you want to delete the selected form. Click on OK to make a copy or Close to close the dialog box and cancel the deletion.\n  Field level properties When you add controls to forms Kianda Designer, and select a field/control, the properties for that field appear in the right-hand pane.\nThe type of field/control is listed in the properties pane, for example ‘Text box’ as shown in the image above. How the field appears is easy to control simply by checking/unchecking a number of boxes. To find out more about field/control properties go to the Control properties page.\nVersion History The process design in Kianda maintains a compreensive version history of any changes made to the platform. The Version number of a process will be updated every time a process design is saved by clicking on Save button.\nThe designer maintans two types of versions: Draft and published. Draft versions are only visible to administrators and designers while the last published version is visible to end users.\nA design without a published version cannot be used by an end-user to create a new record.\nThe current or active version of a process is always visible in the right-hand pane, for example V0.34.\nThe first version of a process is 0.1 and will increment to 0.2 and so on, each time a process is saved. Once the process is published the version changes to 1.0 and increments with each publication.\nIf the process is subsequently saved, then the next version will be V1.1 and the next published version will be V2.0.\nUsing versioning makes it is easy to keep track of changes and to restore the design to an older version if needed.\nProcess Settings You can use Settings to control process wide settings for the current process design and control things like behavious of form tabs, process security and anonymous access of the process.\nGeneral settings Process ID Settings: Use this to control how the process record ID generation. The default record ID is a combination of the process ID and the record ID,example: process-1.\nWith this setting designers can use any combination of fields or expression to generate the record unique ID.\nOnload rules execution mode: Controls when onload rules execute. The options are: Always, when in edit mode and When its a new record\nEnable form assignment notification: Enables automatic push notifications to be send to assigee user when a record is assigned to them.\nPrevent closing an instance with unsaved data: This allows the system to prompt to save unsaved changes to a form record if the user attempts to navigate away without saving first.\nEnable process chat: Enables process level chat features for a given process record.\nSecurity Use the security tab to configure security settings for the process.\nEnable process security: Enables or disables process level security. Users without access to the record receive access denied error.\nThe following are the available security modes:\n Restricted creator: With this security mode only indicated users can create a new record of the process, users assigned to the record can update it and everyone else can only view it. Restricted assign to: With this security mode only indicated users can create a new record, assign to users can view or modify it, everyone else cannot view the record. Restricted: This is the most restricted security mode. Only directly indicated users can create, view or update records.  Tabs Use the tabs to configure how the process tabs will behave including its look \u0026 feel. Control here setttings such hidding the form tabs altogether, hidding the workspace left nav and enabling the mobile footer navbar.\nYou can also configure here the colours for the selected tab and trhe completed (submited) tab.\nAnonymous form Use the anonymous form tab to enable at process level anonymous form submission.\nWhen enabled the user has the option to create the new record anonymous link. This is a unique link that allows users to submit new records without authentication.\nProcess instances When your process is created in Designer, you can save the process, and then submit data to that process. When you save or submit data, then an instance of the process is created. Another name for a process instance is a record. This instance is tied to user data or calculated values, or to whatever the process is designed to do.\nThe instance has a unique ID which can be seen in a list widget in a dashboard. For example, this List widget displays the individual records of various training requests submitted by employees. The unique ID for each record is shown in the first column. Form owners or those with security access can click on ID ‘training-request-and-feedback-process-26’ to view the training request form completed and submitted by employee Mark Donnelli.\nList widget in a dashboard showing process instances\nThis means that each new record generated by a process will have its own unique URL that can be shared with those who have the required security access and need to be involved in that particular process instance. For example, in this case, the training request submitted by Mark (an employee) may be viewed and approved by his line manager:\nYou can create a link on your dashboard – in the example shown above, the Start new process button at the top right of the Training Requests list widget – that enables you to create a new record by bringing you into the relevant form. For information on creating list widgets go to List widget.\nIf you commit to the process by submitting or saving information, then the result is a new process instance – that is, a new unique record – which will be seen in a list widget in the dashboard, as seen in the image above.\nKeeping in mind that Designer is used to create processes, and that each ‘run’ of the process design results in a unique process instance or record, will help you later on when designing forms and dashboards.\nInstance Common fields The non-design fields associated with all Kianda processes are listed below. It is useful to keep these fields in mind when designing forms, as they can be used to retrieve, store or display values from process instances for example Status which is the status of a process instance. Using these ‘internal values’ could be useful where the status of one process could be used as a condition to trigger the start of another process, for example using the Start a process rule.\nThe common fields associated with process instances are:\n   Field name Explanation     ID This is the process instance ID, labelled as ‘process-name-number’, for example ‘safety-inspection-8’. This ID is part of the URL that brings you to the process instance/record held on the system when information is either submitted or saved. For example clicking on the process instance ID ‘safety-inspection-8’ in a dashboard brings you to the form.   Unique ID This is a system generated ID for each process instance, a 32 letter and number generated value.   Status This is the status for the process instance, that is either a ‘form name’ or ‘Completed’. Completed indicates that all forms in a process have been submitted, while ‘form name’ indicates what the active form is in the process, that is, where the process is ‘at’. For example in a process of two forms, a Request form and an Approval form. Once the Request form has been submitted then the status for a process is ‘Approval form’ indicating that this form needs to be completed.   Version This is the process instance version number that starts as 1.0. If a process instance is updated, for example if a process design is updated and published and process instances are updated with the change, then the next version of the instance will be 2.0.   Process Version This is the process design version, that is the version of the process design that has been used as a template for the process instance.   Process Name This is the Unique ID name that comes from the process design that is the template for the process instance. The ID is created when the process is created. The ID field autofills from the title of the process as shown in Create your first process.   Process Title This is the Process title that comes from the process design title, created when the process is created or updated, for example see Create your first process.   Created This is a date and time stamp when the process instance is created.   Created by This is the user name of the user who created the process instance.   Modified This is the date and time stamp when the process instance is modified, for example after a process design is published and existing process instances are updated.   Modified by This is the user name of the user who modified the process instance.   Assign to This is the user name of the user who a process is assigned to. Process designs may have a static option for reassignment in their design so that process instances can be reassigned using Quick actions. Alternatively the Assign form rule can be used to dynamically assign form ownership to another user. That user is named in the Assign to field.   Security users These are the named security users, defined using Process settings by selecting Enable process security and naming Process security users which can be Users, Groups and/or Partners.

These include 16 built-in controls across three categories: Input, Layout, and Actions. Developers with the appropriate permissions—Administrator or Developer—can also create custom field widgets. These custom widgets appear in the Custom controls category within Kianda Designer, ready to be added to any form or process.\nBecause Kianda is built on open technologies like CSS, JavaScript, and Handlebars, creating custom fields feels familiar to experienced web developers. Rather than dealing with closed, proprietary components, you’ll use the same web standards you already know. The result is a flexible, low-code approach that lets you craft the exact user experiences your business workflows require.\nHow Custom Controls Work Custom controls are created using Kianda’s Developer interface. Each widget you create has two main parts:\n Widget UI (Handlebars template): Defines the markup, event handlers, and expressions. Widget Code (JavaScript): Implements the widget’s logic and functions.  This approach lets you cleanly separate your presentation and logic layers, making it easy to iterate, maintain, and reuse code.\nHandlebars Syntax Kianda leverages Ember.js, an open-source JavaScript framework, which uses the Handlebars templating library for its UI. Handlebars is a simple way to create dynamic templates, using curly brace syntax (e.g., {{...}}) to bind data or call actions.\nFor example, consider the snippet below. It uses a {{field-picker}} component inside a {{#if (eq displayMode \"settings\")}} block. The field-picker lets users select which field in the form should be tied to a particular widget setting.\n{{#if (eq displayMode \"settings\")}}\u003cdiv class=\"form-group\"\u003e \u003clabel class=\"control-label\"\u003eImage to place pictures into\u003c/label\u003e {{field-picker process=process required=true allowText=false includes='[\"fields/field-image\"]' value=field.settings.imageDestination}}\u003clabel class=\"control-label\"\u003eField to display warning message in\u003c/label\u003e {{field-picker process=process required=true allowText=false value=field.settings.warningMessage}}\u003c/div\u003e {{/if}}Components like field-picker, field-date, field-group, and field-textbox help you rapidly build forms. You can inspect and understand these components using the Ember inspector add-in.\nGetting Started with Custom Field Widgets To create a custom field widget, you need to have the Administrator or Developer role. Check Users \u0026 Groups for details on permissions. Once you’re set:\n  Go to Administration \u003e Developer in the main menu. The Developer resources page shows all existing widgets. You can filter by widget type “Field” to see existing field controls.\n  Click New widget to start creating a new custom field widget.\n  In the Edit widget dialog, enter:\n Title: A user-friendly name. Unique Id: Auto-populated from the title, but can be adjusted if needed. Widget Icon: Select from a wide range of icons. Widget type: Choose “Field” to create a field widget.    Click OK to confirm. The new widget appears in your widget list.\n  Open the widget to find two tabs:\n Widget UI: Add your Handlebars markup, bindings, and helper code. Widget Code: Add your JavaScript logic and event handlers.    From the Developer resources view, you can edit, delete, or restore previous versions of your widget using the available icons. This makes it easy to iterate on your design or roll back changes if needed.\n  Once saved, your custom field widget appears in Kianda Designer. Navigate to: Administration \u003e Designer \u003e Open or create a process \u003e Select a form, and you’ll see your new custom field under Controls \u003e Custom.\n  Example: Creating a Custom Field Widget Below is an example of a custom field widget called “Image display.” It helps users select an image frame based on their choice in a dropdown list. This widget:\n Updates a “warning” text box field to inform the user when they are in preview mode. Lets the user choose a colored frame for an image displayed in another field.  Sample Widget UI Code This Handlebars template changes its behavior depending on the displayMode (design, edit, settings, or display). During edit mode, for example, it provides a dropdown that triggers an action to update an image field in the form.\n{{#if (eq displayMode \"design\")}}\u003cselect class=\"form-control\"\u003e \u003coption value=\"\"\u003ePlease configure my settings before use\u003c/option\u003e \u003c/select\u003e {{/if}}{{#if (eq displayMode \"edit\")}}\u003cselect class=\"form-control\" id=\"entityType\" onchange={{action 'frameSelected' value=\"target.value\"}}\u003e \u003coption value=\"\"\u003eSelect\u003c/option\u003e \u003coption value=\"https://.../green.jpg\"\u003eGreen\u003c/option\u003e \u003coption value=\"https://.../red.jpg\"\u003eRed\u003c/option\u003e \u003coption value=\"https://.../yellow.jpg\"\u003eYellow\u003c/option\u003e \u003coption value=\"https://.../purple.jpg\"\u003ePurple\u003c/option\u003e \u003c/select\u003e {{/if}}{{#if (eq displayMode \"settings\")}}\u003cdiv class=\"form-group\"\u003e \u003clabel class=\"control-label\"\u003eImage to place pictures into\u003c/label\u003e {{field-picker process=process required=true allowText=false includes='[\"fields/field-image\"]' value=field.settings.imageDestination}}\u003clabel class=\"control-label\"\u003eField to display warning message in\u003c/label\u003e {{field-picker process=process required=true allowText=false value=field.settings.warningMessage}}\u003c/div\u003e {{/if}}{{#if (eq displayMode \"display\")}}\u003cselect class=\"form-control\" onchange={{action 'frameSelected' value=\"target.value\"}}\u003e \u003coption value=\"\"\u003eSelect\u003c/option\u003e \u003coption value=\"https://.../green.jpg\"\u003eGreen\u003c/option\u003e \u003coption value=\"https://.../red.jpg\"\u003eRed\u003c/option\u003e \u003c/select\u003e {{/if}}Sample Widget Code This JavaScript defines what happens in each mode. For example, in edit mode it shows a warning message, and when the user selects a frame, it updates the target image field.\n{  edit: function() {  var process = this.get('field.process');  var warningMessage = process.findFieldByName(this.get(\"field.settings.warningMessage.name\"));  warningMessage.set(\"visible\", true);  warningMessage.set(\"enabled\", false);  warningMessage.set(\"text\", \"Preview mode: Not actual process\");  },  display: function() {  var process = this.get('field.process');  var warningMessage = process.findFieldByName(this.get(\"field.settings.warningMessage.name\"));  warningMessage.set(\"visible\", false);  },  actions: {  frameSelected: function(image) {  var process = this.get('field.process');  var imageDestination = process.findFieldByName(this.get(\"field.settings.imageDestination.name\"));  imageDestination.set(\"text\", image);  }  } } After saving, the new “Image display” widget appears in the Developer resources list:\nUsing Your Custom Field in a Form Once your custom field widget is created, you can use it in any process within Kianda Designer:\n  In Administration \u003e Designer, open or create a process, then open the relevant form.\n  Under Controls \u003e Custom, find and add your custom widget—like “Image display.”\n  Configure the widget by selecting which fields it should update. For example, map a “Warning” text box and an “Image” field that the widget will control.\n  Save and Preview the form to see your custom field in action. When you choose a frame color from the dropdown, the selected image field updates accordingly.\n  This approach combines the flexibility of standard web technologies with the convenience of a low-code environment. By building custom field widgets on open web technologies, Kianda empowers you to create tailored, dynamic business applications that evolve with your organization’s needs—no proprietary lock-in, and no steep learning curve.\n If you have any questions or need further guidance, explore the related documentation on Ember.js, Handlebars, and the Ember inspector. You’ll find that with your existing CSS and JavaScript skills, you can seamlessly extend Kianda’s capabilities and deliver custom, interactive process apps quickly and efficiently.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Kianda offers a range of predefined field (control) widgets to help …","ref":"/low-code/field-widget/","tags":"","title":"Field widget development"},{"body":"When creating forms, it is important to consider form access during the design phase, that is who can access and edit forms in a process instance. For example if an employee submits a performance review form, a line manager may wish to access that submitted process instance/record and edit the form, adding in comments and performance grades.\nThere are two key principles to keep in mind in terms of form access:\n  Forms are assignable - this means that forms can be assigned to individuals and/or groups, and then only they can edit the form, when it is the current form, in a process instance. The ‘assignee’ can be a combination of users and groups. There are various ways a form can be assigned to a user:\n​\ta) Using Rules, in particular the Workflow rule Assign form, see Assign form for details\n​\tb) Using Quick actions, see Form Quick action for details\n​\tc) Creating form owners when creating or updating a process design, see Creating form owners for details\n  Only form owners can edit a given form when it is a current form in a process flow by default. Any other user with access to view the form will see it in read-only mode.\n  So what is form owner? A form owner is assigned when a form is created in Kianda Designer. Form owners can also be added to a form design at a later stage by editing the form. Only the form owner will be able to edit current forms in process instances (records), see below.\nChanging form access The default owner is the person or group that the form is assigned to using the default owner field in the new form dialog box as shown above. By default, only this person or group can edit the current form in a process instance. All other users can only view forms in read mode. The next section details how to Change default owners.\nIt is also possible to allow other users to have edit access to forms using the Assign rule and Quick actions.\nChanging default owners   Using your Administration or Design business process role, go to Administration \u003e Designer \u003e select a process \u003e select a form in the process.\n  Click on the form so the Edit/Pen button appears in the form name.\n  Then click on the Edit/Pen button itself to edit the form.\n  An Edit form dialog box opens which has the same layout as the New form dialog box seen in Creating form owners above.\n  Here you can change the default owner choosing from Users, Groups as before.\n  ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"When creating forms, it is important to consider form access during …","ref":"/platform/designer/forms/owners/","tags":"","title":"Form owners"},{"body":"Rules are an important component of any process as they can be used to trigger automated actions, requiring minimal user management once created. There are 60 predefined rules in Kianda covering workflow applications, communications and file management to name a few.\nCategories of rules   Workflow - Enables you to execute actions that might change the flow of the information within a process.\n  Communications - Enables sending emails or meeting requests or even user (push) notifications.\n  Data - This is an important and flexible rule group because it allows you to configure CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) actions to configured data sources.\n  Users - This enables you to retrieve a user property, updating user properties or lookup for a user based on a user attribute.\n  File management - Allows operations such as the generation of a word document and conversion to PDF and more.\n  Tables - Provides specialised rules to enable working with tables like sorting, copying table rows to another table and more.\n  Dates - Enables convenient date calculation with advanced options like ignoring weekends or special dates.\n  Form actions - Allows operations like submit, save, close and delete forms.\n  SharePoint - Provides a variety of operations to be performed on the SharePoint connection. These rules include operations like create a list, find a user, define permission to an item, check-in / out an item or adding a user to a SharePoint group.\n  Working with rules The following headings step through how to view, add, copy, edit and disable rules in processes. It is also important to keep in mind how rules should be listed when multiple rules are used on the same field.\nWhen to add a rule   to a field\n  to a form\n  to a process (the rule will run on load)\n  How to view a rule If rules have already been created\n  Select the field or form that contains a rule, for example a button at the end of a form. If a field within a form has rules attached to it, this will be indicated within the form, as shown in the example below where the column Instances has 1 rule attached.\n  Under Rules in the right-hand pane, click on the given rule name to view the rule details, for example a ‘Set form’ rule called ‘Set link’ as shown below.\n  Details of the rule are available in the Edit rule dialog box, for example the Set form field rule is shown below.\n  You can view rule conditions by clicking on Edit conditions and actions to be performed as part of the rule are under Action. Other features to note in the dialog box are:\n Expression button used to add expressions to rules so that dynamic values can be returned based on calculations or form IDs, see Expressions for more details. Mapping - mapping is used within rule actions, for example in the Set form field rule shown in the image above, the rule updates a form field based on a given value or expression. In many other fields mapping can be used to determine success or error during rule execution, see Success and error mapping for more details.  How to add a rule To add a rule to a specific component:\n  Select the field you want.\n  Under Add a rule, select a category of rules, and then select the rule you want.\n  Edit the rule dialog box and click ‘OK’. The rule will be displayed on the right-hand side of the page.\n  How to copy a rule Duplicating rules can be very useful where you have similar rules that are associated with different fields. To duplicate a rule:\n  Select the field with the desired rule.\n  Under Rules in the right-hand pane, click on the Duplicate rule button next to the rule name.\n  Choose Copy to another field if you wish to copy to another field and select the field you want to copy to. Select OK when complete.\n  Alternatively select OK without copying to another field or click on Close at any time to exit the dialog box.\n  How to edit a rule Follow the steps to View an existing rule to open the Edit rule dialog box.\nIn the Edit rule dialog box, you can change:\n The Title of the rule Create or edit conditions for the rule by clicking on the Edit conditions button. Change how the rule performs by changing details under Action. Actions will differ depending on the rule in use.  How to disable a rule Disabling a rule means that the rule is not active but is still visible in the Rules pane. The rule can be activated at any time again by clicking on the toggle button.\n  Select the field that contains a rule, for example a button at the end of a form, or a field within a form that has rules attached.\n  Under Rules in the right-hand pane, beside the given rule name slide the toggle button from ‘on’ to ‘off’ to view the rule details, for example a ‘Set form’ rule called ‘Set link’ as shown below.\n  To enable the rule at any time again follow the steps above and slide the toggle button into the ‘on’ position.\n  Where to place a rule in a list of rules The rule order refers to the order of execution of multiple rules. To change the rule order:\n  Select the field with the rules attached.\n  Under Rules in the right-hand pane, drag and drop the rules in the order you want them.\n  The top-most rule is the first rule to be executed. By default buttons at the end of a form will automatically have Submit, Save, and Close rules. If you create rules you may wish to have these rules placed above these shutdown rules so that your rules are executed first before form shutdown.\nNote: Rule order becomes important when the output of one rule impacts the execution of another, for example if a process remains ‘open’ because a user must perform a particular action, then it is useful to have an automated email reminder sent to the user while the process is open. For example the order of rules on a Submit button could be: Set Status, Send Email, Submit, Save, Close, whereby the status of the process instance is set first, before an automated email and then the form shutdown rules of Submit, Save and Close occur.\nTo read more about multiple rules, go to Multiple rules.\n  Conditions Flexible and dynamic conditions form an important component to make forms fully dynamic. This feature enables you to create natural language conditions when rules should be triggered.\nTo configure a rule to conditionally execute an action:\n Select the field or form that the rule will be attached to. Under Add a rule in the left-hand pane, click on a category of rules, for example Workflow and then a rule itself, for example Process security. Click on Edit conditions button within the rule. Add the conditions that satisfy your scenario. Multiple conditions can be grouped with condition groups.  For more information on Conditions, go to the Conditions page.\nCustom rules Under custom rules, you will find any custom-developed rules available under your developer section. Custom rules provide access to rules that are built for extensibility of Kianda capabilities. This is particularly used in situations when existing rules do not provide the required functionality.\nCustom rules have the purpose of providing a user interface for the end-users. If you need to build a rule then you should use a custom rule widget.\nIt allows a developer to quickly build a reusable component that would then be used by process designers in real processes.\nCheck-out the development section for more details on how to build custom widgets in Kianda.\nWhat’s next  We have briefly introduced the key concepts of rules.

You can select a user by defining one in a user picker field or selecting the current user, meaning that the user currently filling out the form will be selected when retrieving a profile property of a profile attribute. For example you can retrieve properties such as First Name, Last Name, Email or Phone number of a current user, those property values can be used fill in fields associated with a user.\nWhen to use Use this rule when you need to retrieve a profile property or a profile attribute from a current user or a user defined in a user picker field.\nYou can add this rule:\n to a field to a form to a process (the rule will run on load)  Before getting started In advance of using the Get user property rule, in your process you need to have created at least one or more forms. The rule also requires you to select a user profile source, the source can be the current user of the form or a user chosen within a User picker field. When selecting the current user option, you will target the property of the user that is currently using the form. When you pick the user picker field, you need to create a User picker field which is used to select a user to target when retrieving a property. The rule also requires a text box field which is used as a container to store the retrieved value of the property.\n User picker (required) - field used to select a user for which you want to update a property. To learn more about user picker field go to User picker control. Text box (required) - field used as a container to store the value of the property. To learn more about text box field go to Text box control.  How to get started   Click on an existing process by going to Administration \u003e Designer and decide which form, or field you will apply the rule to, by clicking on that item so that it is in edit mode so you can see the Edit/pen button, Pen button .\n  Click on Add a rule \u003e Users \u003e Update user property.\n  In the Edit rule - Update user property dialog box, give the rule a title in the Title field.\n  If you want to add conditions for the rule, click on the Edit conditions button see Conditions for more details.\n  Under the Action section fill out the following:\n  User profile source - select which type of source you want to use as the user to update the property for, choose from:\n  Current user - selecting this option will result in targeting the user that is currently using the form.\n  Defined in a user picker field - selecting this option will result in a Pick a user field option to appear allowing you to select a user picker field from your process. This will then specify which user you are targeting when wanting to retrieve a property, see image below:\n    Field to store user profile property - you can select a field within your process to store the value of the retrieved property.\n  User profile property - list of profile properties and profile attributes that you can retrieve. Note that you can create your own profile attributes which also appear in the list, to learn more about profile attributes go to Profile attributes.\n    You can choose to retrieve more than one property of a user, to do so click on the button. This will result in adding more Field to store user profile property and User profile property fields. You can also delete unwanted fields by clicking on the red Bin/trash icon.\n  When you are finished editing the dialog box, click on OK or click on Close at any time to exit the dialog box.\n  Editing, deleting or duplicating rules When you have clicked on an existing rule, and the rule is visible in the right-hand pane under Rules, there are a number of options available to you.\n To disable a rule click the slider across beside the rule name. To copy a rule, click on the Duplicate button beside the rule name. To delete a rule, click on the Bin/Trash button . To view a rule, click on the rule name to open the Edit rule dialog box.  User tip   Use this rule to automate processes when a form requires information from a users profile. For example when a form contains field such as name, phone number or email address, you can use this rule to automatically set those fields by retrieving the users name, phone number and email address properties.

See Create First Process to learn how to create your first process.  Once you have opened your process, select the form you want to work on (so that the Edit Form button is shown). Click on Controls in the left-hand pane so the Controls menu expands to show the four categories of Controls (fields): Input, Layout, Actions and Custom.  Select Input to view the eight types of Input fields:  The eight types of input fields are:\n Text box - A text box field is a section in your form where users can enter text, for example, an Address field. See Text box control for more information. List - A list field lists information, for example from a SharePoint data source. This is particularly useful for drop-down menus, when you want a user to fill out a form and choose an item from a list. See List control for more information. Number - A number field provides an input box that only allows numeric input, such as currencies or percentages. See Number control for more information. Date - A date field provides a date and time picker that allows users to input both date and time. See Date control for more information. File - A file field allows users to upload multiple files. Uploaded files are stored within the configured data structures or folders. See File upload control for more information. Table - A table field creates a table for input in a form. This table can be filled by the user, or autofilled as part of a rule. See Table control for more information. User picker - A user picker field allows users to choose from a list of users. This can be a preconfigured group (like HR Managers) or a list of users - see User picker control for more information. Toggle - A toggle field can be used as a toggle or checkbox that allows users to turn on/off components of the form. See Toggle control for more information.  How to add, edit, move and delete Input fields To insert an Input field into your form click on the field type you want to add from the Input menu.\nFor example, to add a new text box field, click on Text box - a pop-up message will appear saying ‘Field added’ and a new text box with the default name Text box 1 will be added to your form.\nTo edit whatever type of input field you have added to your form:\n Select the field (by either clicking on the field name or on the Drag handle button ) Then click on the Edit Field button (Pen icon) . The Edit Field dialog box will automatically open, providing you with a variety of options for editing the field - such as changing the Title of the field - depending on the type of Input field you are working with.  To move an Input field, simply\n Select the field’s Drag handle button  Drag and drop the field wherever you want to move it within your form. This example shows how you could move a Text box field in a form:  To delete an Input field from your form:\n Select the field (by either clicking on the field’s name or its Drag handle button ) Click on the Bin/Trash button  Click on OK to confirm.  You can also view and edit an input field’s Field Properties by selecting the field - for more details, see Field Properties.\nSaving changes and version history Make sure to save any changes you make by clicking on the Save button . You will always have the option to revert back to previous versions of your form by clicking the Design Version History button in the top right corner.\nWhat’s next  We have briefly introduced each of the eight types of Input controls.

A process instance is created every time data is either saved or submitted to Kianda’s database for a given process design, see Process instance for more details.\nHow to get started Before you get started, there are three things to keep in mind:\n  To use API methods in Kianda you must have an administrator role, go to View and edit user details to see information on how to set roles.\n  Each API method requires a Bearer token, see Authentication for more details.\n  Each of the following methods can be used on process instances or records, where {name} is the name of a process instance, such as ’training-approval-request-1'.\n  REST API Methods You can perform Create, Read, and Update operations on Kianda resources using standard HTTP method requests, as summarised below:\n   Method Description     POST Create a process instance   GET Read/Retrieve process instance fields   PUT Update a process instance   PATCH Partially update a process instance    Before any of the requests are used, you must have the bearer access token inserted into the request header, see Authentication for details.\nCreate a process instance - POST This request creates a process instance/new record. To use POST:\n Use the following request format:  {{domain}}/api/instances/create  Ensure that the bearer token is inserted into the authorisation header\n  Pass parameters into the body of the request, for example to create a new instance of a process called ’new-training-process’ where a textbox field called ‘Reason’ will be prepopulated with a value:\n{  \"processName\" :\"new-training-process\",  \"instanceID\" : \"new-training-process\",  \"TriggerField\":\"\",  \"FieldsMappings\":[{  \"fieldname\":\"reason\",  \"text\":\"New employee\",  \"value\":\"New employee\"  }  ] }   The Response Body will be as follows:\n  { \t\"success\":true, \t\"instanceID\":\"new-training-process-70\" } In the example above a new instance is created with an ID ’new-training-process-70’. The new instance can be see in a List widget in a dashboard as follows.\nIn this example the Reason text box is populated from the POST request.\nRead/Retrieve process instance fields - GET {{domain}}/api/instances/{name}/fields?names=field1,field2.. where `{name}`is the name of the process instance.  This request retrieves the values of multiple fields by name.\nNo Request Body is required.\nThe Response Body will be as follows:\n{ \t\"name\":\"\", \t\"text\":\"\", \t\"value\":\"\", } Update a process instance - PUT {{domain}}/api/instances/{name} where `{name}`is the name of the process instance.  This request updates all fields in the instance by performing a comparison based on version number, to ensure there are no duplicate process instances.\nThe Request Body for the PUT request is:\n{ \t\"ProcessName\":\"\", \t\"FieldsMappings\":[], \t\"TriggerField\":\"\", \t\"Status\":\"\" } The Response Body will be as follows:\n{ \t\"ProcessName\":\"\", \t\"FieldsMappings\":[], \t\"TriggerField\":\"\", \t\"Status\":\"\" } ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" Introduction Kianda’s REST Application Programming Interface (API) …","ref":"/apis/instances/","tags":"","title":"Instances"},{"body":"A dashboard List widget displays the instances of the selected process in a dashboard.

When selected the rule allows you to trigger fields or rules to perform a particular action within the specified table. For example if a button is added to the table with an associated action, you can then trigger that action while looping through the table.\nFor example in the table below, there is a Calculate total button in a Calculate total column. This button has a rule that will set a value in the field in the Total column. Using the Loop table rule every row is looped through and this Calculate total button rule is triggered, completing the fields for each row in the Total column.\nIf the Loop table rule isn’t used, the user has to manually click on the Calculate Total button for each row, to populate the field in the Total column.\nWhen to use This rule is often used when the same action must be performed for multiple rows within a table.\nYou can add this rule:\n to a field to a form to a process (the rule will run on load)  Before you get started To demonstrate this rule, we will loop through a simple Purchase table described in the introduction above, in which we will calculate the total price spent on each item bought. To learn more on how to add a table into your form go to In the table we will have the following columns:\n  Item - text box field representing the name of the item bought. To learn how to add a text box field go to Text box control.\n  Price - number field representing the price of the item. To learn how to add a number field go to Number control.\n  Quantity - number field representing the quantity of the item.\n  Total - number field representing the total quantity spent on the item.\n  Calculate total - a button with a Set form field rule attached. To learn more on how to add and how to use the Set form field go to Set form field rule.\n  The goal in this example is to loop though the table and trigger the Calculate total button so that for each item purchased, the total can be calculated depending on its quantity.\nHow to get started   Click on an existing process by going to Administration \u003e Designer and decide which form, or field you will apply the rule to, by clicking on that item so that it is in edit mode so you can see the Edit/pen button, Pen button .\n  Click on Add a rule \u003e Table \u003e Loop table.\n  In the Edit rule - Loop table dialog box, give the rule a title in the Title field.\n  In the Select a table option, select the table you want to loop through.\n  In the Select a column field or rule to trigger option, select a field or rule you want to trigger when looping through the table. In this example, we will select the Calculate total button from the table column.\n  Enable start action gives you two options:\n Yes - allows you to select a field that will execute before the loop starts. No - means no changes are made, the loop will execute straight away.    Enable end action gives you two options:\n Yes - allows you to select a field that will execute after the loop finishes. No - means no changes are made, the loop will end without any action.

Each element of the email is configurable. The body of the email can include text, images and attachments. Data stored in fields in the current form can be copied in dynamically.\nWhen to use the Send email rule You can add this rule:\n to a field to a form to a process (the rule will run on load)  Before you get started In advance of using this rule, you need to have created one or more forms, complete with control fields. For example a text box control with an employee’s ‘Name’ may be part of a form ‘Annual Leave Request’. Then this ‘Name’ field can be used as an expression in the email to send personalised emails, so these aspects must be set up in advance.\n Decide how the rule will be implemented, for example will an email be sent once a form is saved or submitted. In the example of form submit, then click on that form in the process \u003e Submit button \u003e Add a rule \u003e Send email. Decide who the automated email will be sent from, for example a no-reply type email. If you leave the From field empty, the email will be sent from noreply@kianda.com. If you want your email to come from a different sender, then go to Email connector for more details on how to set that up. Any email addresses to send To, From, CC or BCC must be set up in advance. This could be a textbox in a form called ‘Email address’ with a unique Name like ’emailAddress’, or it could be a user picker field associated with particular users, groups or partners. If you want to track the emails, then you must set up a field in your form to store email tracking. If you want to attach any files to an email, files must first be stored in a File field in one of the forms.

To learn more about conditions go to Conditions.\n  From - who the email is from, click on Person button and choose from the appropriate Selection mode, see Selection mode below.\nWarning\nIf you add an email address to the From field, you must specify an Email connector, see Email connector. If a connector is not specified, the emails will come from noreply@kianda.com. If a Global SMTP connector is configured, all emails will be sent from the global connector.\n  To - who the email is to, click on Person button and choose from the appropriate Selection mode, see Selection mode below.\n  CC - who will be copied on the email, as with To field.\n  BCC - who will be blind copied on the email, as with To field.\n  Subject - type in your email subject and click on the Ellipsis button to add an expression, go to Expression builder for more information. The Subject cannot be left empty.\n  Body - choose from an array of styles and formats to create your email including Style, Colour, Font size, Remove font style, Font family, Unordered list, Ordered list, Paragraph, Table, Link, Picture, Attach a File and Code view. For example if you click on Code view button you can copy HTML code directly into the body text.\nIf you click on the Picture button you will be redirected to the File storage area where you can search for existing images stored in the Kianda file system, create a folder, or upload a file.\nTo find out more about how to attach a file, see Attachments for more details.\nTo add a message to your email, click on the Body text box. You can personalise automated emails using fields from the process by clicking on the Ellipsis button to add an expression, see Expression builder for more details.\n  Send via connector - options are a) No or b) Yes\nIf you choose Yes then you must choose an Email connector and decide if you want to Save Sent Items (Yes or No) which means sent emails are saved in a sent items folder in your email account. For more information go to Email connector Note that if Global SMTP Mail connector has been configured, all emails sent will use the Global connector settings instead, including no-reply@kianda.como find out more, go to Setting up a Global SMTP mail connector.\n  Enable tracking - options are a) No or b) Yes\n    Note that this option is only available if Send via connector is set to No and the email is being sent from noreply@kianda.com.\n  If you choose Yes then you must click into the field under Field to store tracking event (Open, Click, Bounce, Spam) and choose a field from a form to store the event.\n   This option allows you to track the email after it is sent. All of these events, Open, Click, Bounce and Spam will be tracked.   Click on OK button when you are finished editing to save your changes or click on Close to exit the dialog box without saving.\n  Note when your rule is complete you may want to change the order of rules for the particular field or form that it has been applied to. Drag the new Send email rule to where you want, so the order of execution of rules is correct.\nFor example for a Submit button on a form I may want my Send email rule to be executed first before any other rule is executed. To do this click on the Submit button to make sure you are in Edit mode, and under Rules in the right-hand pane, drag the Send email rule to the top of the list by clicking on the rule and dragging it.\nFor more information on rule order, see Multiple Rules.\n    Email connector The Email connector is a mailing tool that allows you to send emails with a specified email account, for example support@ or info@. An email connector must be set up in advance, to learn how to set up an Email connector go to Email connector.\nIf you leave the From field empty, the email will be sent from noreply@kianda.com. If you want your email to come from a different sender, follow these steps when you are editing the Send email rule:\n Set Send via connector to Yes. Click into the field under Email connector and select a connector. Click on OK button when you are finished editing to save your changes or click on Close to exit the dialog box without saving.  Note that if Global SMTP Mail connector has been configured, all emails sent will use the Global connector settings instead of what is specified in the send email rule. Go to Administration \u003e Subscription \u003e Subscription Details to check for a global setting or to find out more, go to Setting up a Global SMTP mail connector.\nSelection mode When you are filling out the To, From, CC or BCC fields and click on the Person button you have the following selection mode options to choose from:\n  Any user or partner\n  User(s) defined in a user field\n  Form owner(s)\n  Email address in a field.\n   Note; You can reset user/ field you selected by clicking Clearon the dropdown field in the Select email users dialog box.\n   Any user or partner - With this Selection mode selected. On the right-hand side of the Select users dropdown list, you can choose to select from Users, Groups and Partners. This allows you to distinguish which users are picked for this field. For example a single user, or a group of users.\n  User(s) defined in a user field - if you choose this option, it means the user name is already defined in a form. By clicking into the Select a user field, you can select a field from the process you are working in.\n  Click on the desired User field in your process to add to the Select a user field box.\n  Click on to add more selection fields.\n  Remove a field clicking on the Bin/Trash button\n    Form owner(s) - With this option selected, by clicking into the field under Form owner of selected form and choose from the forms within that process.

An Expression builder dialog box opens.\n  Click into the field under Add field to expression. Forms and fields that are part of your process appear where you can expand elements to drill down to find the field that you want, for example ‘Employee Name’. Click on the field to add field to the expression.\n  Click on the Add to expression button to add the field as an expression. Note that the expression is the Name(unique) of that field.\n  Click on OK button when you are finished editing to save your changes or click on Close to exit the dialog box without saving.\n  The result is the expression is now part of the automated email.\n  To add more expressions, firstly position your cursor in your body text where you want to add the expression, then click on the Ellipsis button and under Add field to expression clear any existing fields by clicking on the Clear button. This appears when you hover over the Add field box.\nThen search for other fields, for example lists or links, and use the Expression reference functions, see step 7.\n  Click on Reference to find out how to use particular functions in your email. For example ProcessLink() returns the html link to the current process. Copy this function into the Expression box and click on OK to add the function. Then in the Body type in the text you want associated with this link for example “click here” into the brackets of the function:\nIn this way you can build personalised automated emails that provide a link back to a process instance, for example that a manager can view, update or approve. For more information on References and Expressions see Expressions for more information.\n  Attachments To attach a file into the Send email rule, you must first contain a file field in your process. To learn more about file control go to File upload control.\n  To attach a file to an email, click on the Attach a file button . The Attach file to email dialog box opens.\n  Select a File field from your process to attach the file, for example an Image filed as shown in the image below.\n  Click in the File field, find and select the desired field.\n  Click on Insert attachment.

This process, as with all processes, can be used to review data, create new instances, update or delete instances.\nWithin a shared process, you can also create a Shared Dashboard which is a dashboard created within your own subscription with the intention to share with your B2B Portal. This dashboard, as with all dashboards, can be used to review data, access Shared Processes by creating new instances, updating or deleting instances.\nWhen to use Using the Shared Process feature will allow users within the B2B Portal to have access to a process you have created. By sharing this process you will give your partner the opportunity to work on the process by updating, creating and deleting instances.\nIt terms of dashboards, it is necessary to share your dashboard with your B2B Portal when sharing processes and dashboard widgets with your Client. Before you can share a dashboard you must first create one. This dashboard can be one that you have already created, however, we recommend creating a unique dashboard that will be used specifically for sharing with B2B Portals. Go to Dashboards to learn more about how to create dashboards.\nThe following sections will step through how to share a process (steps 1-3) and share a dashboard (step 4) and how to conclude and update partners (steps 5-6).\nHow to get started Log into your subscription and navigate to the Invite Partner section located within Administration. Your role needs to be Administrator or Manage partner to view Invite Partner. Using one of these roles:\n  Navigate to Invite Partner within the Administration section.\n  In the Shared processes section, click on the Share a process button .\n  The Create a Shared Process dialog box opens.\nPopulate the fields as desired:\n  Title - provide a title for the shared process\n  Instructions for partner - provide instructions for the selected partner\n  Click on the plus symbol to add a selected process design to share. Then click on the dropdown list to search for a process to share.\n  Click on the tick symbol to add the selected shared process. To change the selected shared process properties by clicking on the Cog/Settings button or delete the selected shared process by clicking on the Bin/trash button .\n  If you click on the Cog/Settings button a Process properties dialog box appears, as shown above, for example Training Request properties. You can check radio buttons for:\n  Allow partner to create a new process instance - choose from Yes or No. If you choose Yes, then you are allowing invited partner(s) to create new process instances from the chosen shared process design.\n  A field Partner user group allowed to create new instances appears, where you can define the group(s) in the partner organisation, that can create these new process instances. This is the first level of security for processes and dashboards. If you leave the field blank, then anyone in the partner organisation can create process instances.\n  Allow partner delete a process instance - choose from Yes or No. If you choose Yes, then you are allowing invited partner(s) to delete new process instances from the chosen shared process design.\n  Partner process form visibility mode - choose from Assigned or All forms. If you choose Assigned, then the invited partner(s) can view only assigned form versus all forms, if All forms is chosen.\n  When you are finished editing the dialog box, click on OK, or else click on Close to exit the dialog box at any stage.\n  If you click on the Bin/trash button then a pop-up appears to Confirm removal, choose from OK or Cancel.\n    Click on the Tick symbol to add further selected processes to share.\n  Click on the Add partner group button to add one or more partner groups. Click on the Bin/trash button to delete partner groups.\nInformation on dashboard parameters under Add partner group is found under the heading below.\n        Shared dashboards There are a set of dashboard parameters under the field Add partner group. These are:\n  Under Dashboard template click on the dropdown list to select an existing dashboards to share with the selected processes. If you choose to share a dashboard then you can select parameters:\n  Dashboard name in partner - choose from Use your company name ‘Name of your organisation’ or Same as selected dashboard\n  Make welcome page - choose from Yes or No. If you choose Yes then the selected dashboard becomes the welcome page for the partner if no other welcome page is configured.\n  Dashboard security - choose from created partner groups within this field to ensure that only users in these partner groups can access the dashboard. This is the method to set security on the dashboard specifically.\n    When you are finished editing the dialog box, click on OK, or else click on Close to exit the dialog box at any stage.\n  Once you have completed configuring or modifying the Shared Process you will need to send the shared process to your partner. To do this press the Send Update button which appears in the main view of the Shared processes section.\n  What’s next  Once you have successfully creating a shared process and dashboard, these will be available in the B2B Portal for partners, for example when your partner users log into the B2B Portal they will be able to see the newly shared dashboard. From here they will be able to see the widgets within the dashboard and interact with the Processes.

This could be useful, for example, when performing a health \u0026 safety check on a building site. A template can be used by an inspector to have a generic outline of what needs to be completed when preforming the check. Each time a check is performed, the generated report may contain different data. This data is pulled directly from the each individual check when performed by an inspector.\nBefore you get started In advance of creating a template, you need to install Kianda add-in for word. Go to Installing Kianda add-in for Word or Excel and follow the steps of installation. You also need to create an template outline before starting, to learn more about what a template outline is, go to template outline.\nUsing the Kianda Add-in for Word   On the right-hand side of the Home tab, click on the Kianda Add-in.\n  In the Kianda pane log in using your Kianda username and password, select your subscription and press Continue.\n  Click on the process link button to get a drop-down list of Kianda processes that you have access to.\n  Select a relevant process and a relevant form that you want to create a template for.\n  Position your cursor in the Word document at the point where you would like to add in form fields.\n  Select the Kianda form field you would like to add to the Word template.

Unlike the field property ‘Required’, this rule will dynamically allocate a mandatory status on chosen forms or fields, that users must complete and submit.\n  Go to form Go to form rule navigates the user from the current form to the destination form. This rule could also set the destination form’s display mode.\n  Assign form This rule enables dynamic form ownership and form security assignment of a form owner by assigning a user or a group to a form. You could also choose to override or append the form owner. By default only form owners can see the form in edit\n  Process security This rule defines the security of the entire process instance (record). Using this rule, you could add any user or group with the right permissions to view/update any instances.\n  Start a (sub) process Start a process rule helps you create a new instance of the same process or a different process. You could also map the inputs from the current instance to a new instance.\n  Schedule a rule This rule helps you schedule a rule/rules to be triggered one time, with a recurring schedule or immediately. For example, this rule could be used to schedule a daily reminder email to a user if the task is not complete.\n  What’s next  We have briefly introduced each of the six types of Workflow rules. Now let’s look at each of these types of rules in more detail:\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Workflow rules is one category of rules that relates to user …","ref":"/platform/rules/workflow/","tags":"","title":"Workflow rules"},{"body":"There are a number of different ways of setting security within your Kianda workspace. Security refers to both access to processes as a Designer, and access to process instances.\nSecurity privileges by role The Kianda platform allows for different security privileges to be set for different types of users, making administration of users and their access rights easy to manage. The following are the different roles users can be assigned on Kianda – each has certain default permissions:\n User – can only access what is assigned to them. For example, forms and dashboards. Administrator – can access (view and edit) all published processes. Can only edit draft processes that they have created themselves or for which they have been made Process Administrators. Manage partners/customers – can only access the essentials to manage customer portals; that is, they can use the Invite partners function under the Administration menu. Design business process – can only design business forms and workflows using Kianda Designer Manage data sources – can only manage data sources and connections, namely the Data sources function Developer – can design new widgets within the platform using the Developer function  In addition to default permissions, you can also create user groups and assign ownership and/or access to processes or dashboards as needed. Security settings can be applied to dashboards or particular widgets within a dashboard so that they are only visible to certain users or groups of users; and data source connections can be configured in the same way to ensure the highest access control levels. We will now look at different ways of assigning access and controlling security.\nProcess administrators When an Administrator creates a new process in Kianda, they can set who they want the Process Administrators of that process to be (anyone chosen to be a Process Administrator needs to be someone who has an Administrator role, so that they have access to the Designer function to be able to edit the process). The Process Administrators can be individual users, groups or a combination of the two.\nIf you are an Administrator, you can edit a process you have created and set the Administrator role for that process by clicking on the Edit process button (Pen icon) in the main process view. Choose the user(s) and/or groups you want to be the Process Administrator(s) in the Edit process dialog box.\nSetting process administrators in the Edit process dialog box\nIn the example above, Vikky was already a Workspace Administrator who had access to the Designer function in Kianda – now that she has been assigned to be the Process Administrator for the Maintenance Process, this means that she can edit the draft process design.\nForm ownership When you create a process in Kianda, you can then set a default owner for each form you create within that process. Only Form Owners can edit individual process records. For example, if a ‘Maintenance Request Process’ is initiated from a dashboard, then the default Form Owner, regardless of their role (that is, regardless of whether their ‘role’ on Kianda is ‘administrator’ or ‘user’ etc), will be able to edit information submitted in new process records from that form.\nIf you are a Workspace Administrator and you’ve created a new process that contains a form, you can set the default owner for that form by opening the process in Kianda Designer, selecting the form and clicking the Edit form button (Pen icon). This opens the Edit form dialog box within which you can choose from individual users, groups or a combination of both under Default owner(s).\nQuick actions within forms Within the Edit form dialog box, you can select the Enable quick actions checkbox so that options to Enable re-assign, Enable edit and Enable custom action appear. From here, a Process Administrator or form designer can give individuals, groups or a combination of both, the ability to have process instances assigned to them, to enable them to edit in process records and custom actions of their choice.\nEdit form dialog box\nSelect the Enable quick actions checkbox, then select one or more of the checkboxes for the three options that appear below it (as shown in the image). For each of the options you select, click on the ellipsis button and select from Users, Groups and Partners, and/or check the box to Allow form owners the particular action – for example, re-assignment means the chosen users can click on the quick action button in the form and reassign the form to someone else.\nWhat’s next  Now that you’ve learned about Workspace security, find out more about other security access levels:\n Process level security Single Sign-On Data residency  ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"There are a number of different ways of setting security within your …","ref":"/security/workspace-security/","tags":"","title":"Workspace security"},{"body":"When you login to Kianda for the first time, you are presented with an easy-to-use interface, your Kianda workspace, that contains all the functions you need for your role.\nThe main navigation is driven from the left-hand side menu.

Introduction Connecting to data sources is a crucial aspect of building robust and dynamic process applications in Kianda. By integrating external data, you can enhance the functionality and relevance of your forms, automate data-driven tasks, and ensure seamless communication between different systems within your organization.\nThis section will guide you through the basics of managing data sources in Kianda, enabling you to create more powerful and efficient applications.\nYou will learn how to access and configure data sources using Kianda’s administration menu. We will cover the process of registering new data sources, integrating them into your process apps, and utilizing them effectively to meet your business needs.\nAdditionally, you will gain insights into best practices for maintaining and optimizing data source connections, ensuring your applications run smoothly and securely.\nBefore you begin, ensure you have admin privileges within your Kianda workspace, as managing data sources requires access to administrative functions. A basic understanding of the types of data sources you will be working with (such as databases, web services, or file systems) will also be beneficial.\nWith these prerequisites in place, you are ready to start leveraging the full potential of Kianda’s data source integration capabilities.\n2. Accessing and Registering Data Sources To manage and integrate data sources within Kianda, you need to access the Data Sources administration menu.\nThis section will guide you through the steps to navigate the admin menu, understand the data sources landing page, and register a new data source in your workspace.\nNavigating to the Data Sources Admin Menu  Access the Admin Menu  Click on the cog icon located at the top right corner of the screen to open the admin menu.   Select Data Sources  From the admin menu, select the “Data Sources” option to access the Data Sources management page.    The Data sources management page displays a list of all registered data sources in your workspace that can be managed centrally.\nRegistering a New Data Source   Click on the “Add new” button located at the top of the Data Sources management page.\n  Select a Data Source Type. Choose from a variety of supported data sources such as:\n Office 365, SharePoint, SQL Server, Salesforce, DocuSign, MySQL, Oracle, SAP, Active Directory, SOAP Service, REST Service, File System, Email, FTP, Dropbox, PowerShell, Global Payments, Google Drive, Stripe, Autodesk, Procore.    Configuring a New Data Source\nAfter selecting the type of data source, you will be prompted to enter the necessary configuration details.\n Example: Configuring a MySQL Data Source  Display Name: Enter a descriptive name for the data source. Server: Enter the server address (e.g., serverA.company.com). Database: Enter the database name (e.g., products). User: Enter the username for accessing the database. Password: Enter the corresponding password. Test Connection: Click to verify that the connection details are correct.      By following these steps, you can efficiently access and manage data sources in Kianda. This foundational step is crucial for integrating external data into your process applications, enabling you to build more dynamic and data-driven solutions.\nOnce your data sources are registered and configured, you can start integrating them into your process apps using list controls and CRUD rules, which will be covered in the next section.\nYour browser does not support the video tag.   3. Integrating Data Sources with Process Apps Integrating data sources with your process apps in Kianda allows you to dynamically read and display data from external databases directly within your forms.\nThere are two primary methods to achieve this: using the List control for direct binding to data sources and utilizing the Find Items rule. These tools enable you to create forms that interact seamlessly with your data sources, providing real-time access to essential data.\nThe List control in Kianda can be directly bound to a data source, making it a powerful tool for displaying data within your forms. When configuring the List control, you can select the desired data source using the data source picker.\nOnce selected, additional fields are provided to fine-tune the data binding. The Display field specifies the column from the data source that will be shown to users as the display value, while the Value field determines the column that will hold the actual value.\nThis setup is particularly useful for dropdown lists, radio buttons, multi-select options, and checkbox lists, allowing you to populate these controls with data directly from your databases without requiring additional coding.\nBy leveraging the List control and the Find Items rule, you can effectively integrate data sources with your Kianda process apps, providing a dynamic and interactive experience for users.\nThese tools enable you to seamlessly read data from external databases, enhancing the functionality and usability of your forms. In the next section, we will explore how to configure and utilize these controls and rules in detail, ensuring you can implement these integrations smoothly and efficiently.\n3.1. List Control Data Binding Your browser does not support the video tag.   3.2. Find Items Rule (Data Query) Another robust method for reading data into your forms is the Find Items rule. This rule is used to execute a data retrieval (Select) operation from any configured data source and map the results into various controls within your form.\nThe Find Items rule allows you to set conditions for filtering data and specify how the retrieved data should be mapped to form fields or table controls. When mapping to a non-table control, only the first result of the query is mapped.\nAdditionally, the Find Items rule includes a sort order and max rows setting to limit the number of results returned. This feature is particularly useful for displaying query results in a table control, providing a dynamic way to present and manage data within your forms.\nYour browser does not support the video tag.   3.3. Saving Form Inputs to Data Sources Writing data to data sources in Kianda is a crucial functionality that allows users to take input from forms and persist it into various external systems.\nThis can be achieved using the Create Item rule, Update Item rule, and Delete Item rule, which together with the Find Items rule, provide full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.\nThese rules are not limited to databases but can also be applied to non-database data sources such as REST APIs or third-party services, making them extremely versatile for various integration needs.\nThe Create Item rule is used to insert new records into a data source based on user input from a form. This rule supports the creation of one item at a time and, when working with databases, it translates into an INSERT statement.\nThe rule employs a visual transactional logic represented by three panels: Input Mapping, Success Mapping, and Error Mapping. These panels allow you to define what data should be sent to the data source, how to handle successful transactions, and how to manage errors.\nThis conditional logic enables complex workflows where subsequent actions can be triggered based on the success or failure of the initial data write operation.\nSimilarly, the Update Item rule is used to modify existing records in a data source. It can update multiple items in a single operation, which corresponds to an UPDATE statement in database terms.\nThis rule includes a flag to automatically ignore blank values, ensuring that only specified fields are updated. Like the Create Item rule, the Update Item rule uses the same transactional logic with Input Mapping, Success Mapping, and Error Mapping panels.\nThis allows developers to conditionally execute additional logic based on the outcome of the update operation.\nThe Delete Item rule completes the set of CRUD operations by allowing the removal of records from a data source. Together, these rules provide a robust framework for interacting with external data sources, enabling dynamic and responsive process applications.\nBy combining these data rules with the Find Items rule, Kianda users can create comprehensive data management workflows within their forms. For example, a process could begin with a Find Items rule to retrieve existing records, followed by an Update Item rule to modify those records, or a Create Item rule to add new records based on user input.\nThis seamless integration of reading and writing data ensures that Kianda forms can handle complex business scenarios, making your process applications both powerful and flexible.\n4. Best Practices Implementing best practices when integrating and managing data sources in Kianda ensures that your process applications are secure, efficient, and maintainable. Here are some key recommendations to follow:\nPerformance Optimization Optimizing the performance of your data interactions is crucial for maintaining responsive and efficient applications. When designing forms, use server-side filtering and pagination to manage large datasets effectively, avoiding the need to load extensive data sets into the client-side.\nFor frequent data interactions, enable caching where appropriate to reduce the load on your data sources and improve response times.\nAdditionally, optimize your queries and rules to retrieve only the necessary data, and use indexed columns in your databases to speed up search operations.\nKianda automatically performs server side paging and filtering under the hood to ensure that the application is fast and responsive to users.\nSecurity Considerations Securing your data connections is paramount. Restrict access to data sources based on the principle of least privilege, ensuring that only authorized users and services can read or write data.\nUtilize Kianda’s security features, such as data source security, enabling security settings for panels and buttons, to further control access and actions within your forms.\nManaging Data Source Changes Change management is an essential aspect of maintaining data source integrations. Document your data source configurations and changes meticulously.\nBefore making changes to live data sources, test them thoroughly in a development or staging environment to ensure they do not disrupt existing processes. Implement fallback mechanisms and error handling in your forms to manage unexpected issues gracefully.\nRegularly review and audit your data source configurations to ensure they remain aligned with your organizational policies and performance standards.\n5.

Microservices allow developers to focus on developing a service without worrying about dependencies.\nA microservice can be developed using almost any programming language.\nPrerequisites Before you get started, check that the following prerequisites are in place:\n Ability/permissions to create resources with a cloud platform, for example, Google Cloud, AWS or Azure Administration role or permissions within an Admin group within Kianda, see Users and Groups for more information Visual Studio installed or other text editor for your chosen programming language  Microservice Requirements Your microservice should implement the following three functions:\n Test Metadata Query  It is required that the microservice uses security best practices, to encrypt sensitive data using AES encryption and verify that each request and response is secure using a HMAC signature.\nMicroservice Development The following steps for development will use Microsoft Azure cloud as an example, however, other cloud computing platforms with similar features can be used resulting in different naming conventions. The key steps are:\n  Create a serverless Azure function app in Visual Studio by creating a new project, searching for Azure functions and using this as a template to get started. As well as the pre-defined libraries in the template, you must also add the following:\nusing System.Security.Cryptography; using System.Text; using Newtonsoft.Json.Linq; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq;   Implement the functions for Test, Metadata and Query. Click on each of the links to read more. The steps highlighted in bold are unique to the specific function, while the other steps are repeated in all three functions.\n  Debug locally and test using a tool such as Postman or download Kianda Cloud Connect.\n  Deploy to Azure.\n  Test The Test function ensures that the user is authorized to use the datasource. If they are not authorized then this function can be used to authorize the user and retrieve an access token for any further requests.\nThe steps involved in creating the test function are as follows:\n  Deserialize the data in the custom connector request - see schema for details and Test sample code.\n  Decrypt the encrypted settings property bag using the shared secret key and the Decrypt function, see Encryption/Decryption sample code for an example.\n  Authorize the user and retrieve bearer token for subsequent requests and save the token to the settings property bag.\n  Add the oauth token to the settings property bag and encrypt using your secret key.\n  Create custom connector response and include success message to indicate test succeeded/failed.\n  Sign the response using the EncryptdatawithHMACSHA256 method and include in the custom connector response, see Encryption/Decryption sample code for an example.\n  To help you get started, see sample code for the Test function by going to Test sample code.\nMetadata The Metadata function provides the list of available endpoints in the microservice and is called when selecting the datasource in a Kianda process, for example use a particular datasource to populate a List field in a Kianda form.\nThe steps involved in creating the metadata function are as follows:\n  Deserialize the data in the custom connector request - see schema for details.\n  Decrypt the encrypted settings property bag using the shared secret key and the Decrypt function see Encryption/Decryption sample code for an example.\n  Create a JSON tree structure similar to the one found at Tree schema.\n  Create custom connector response and include success message to indicate success/failure.\n  Create a signature string using the EncryptdatawithHMACSHA256 method and include in the custom connector response, see Encryption/Decryption sample code for an example.\n  To help you get started, see sample code for the Metadata function by going to Metadata sample code.\nQuery The Query function is where the execution of the datasource methods occurs, the metadata function provides the list of available methods.\nThe steps involved in creating the query function are as follows:\n  Deserialize the data in the custom connector request - see schema for details.\n  Decrypt the encrypted settings property bag using the shared secret key and the Decrypt function - see Encryption/Decryption sample code for an example.\n  Get the query object from the request - see schema for details, and call the function related to the query in the datasource .\n  Create custom connector response and include success message to indicate query succeeded/failed.\n  Create the query result object - see schema for details, and include in the custom connector response.\n  Sign the response using the EncryptdatawithHMACSHA256 method and include in the custom connector response, see Encryption/Decryption sample code for an example.\n  To help you get started, see sample code for the Query function by going to Query sample code.\nSecurity AES256 Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is the technique used to encrypt sensitive data. This is a symmetric encryption technique, which means the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt the data, it is also a 2-way encryption algorithm.\nHMAC Hash based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) is used to ensure query responses are coming from the correct end point. HMAC is also an encryption algorithm but unlike AES it’s one-way encryption, meaning it isn’t decrypted on the other side. It is used for verification, for example if we encrypt a secret key using HMAC with a request id and then do the same in the response, we can verify that we have got the response back from the correct endpoint and know that it has not been tampered with because both hashes will match. The hash used is SHA256.\nWith AES we are encrypting and decrypting data and this method is fast and secure for large data, while with HMAC we use it to simultaneously verify both the data integrity and authenticity of a message.\nSchemas required for Custom Connectors Custom Connector Request \tpublic class CustomConnectorRequest  {  public string subscriptionId { get; set; }  public string userId { get; set; }  public string requestId { get; set; }  public string action { get; set; }  public string encryptedSettingsPropertyBag { get; set; }  public byte[] iv { get; set; }  public Query query { get; set; }  } Request Query Object  public class Query {  public string id { get; set; }  public string action { get; set; }  public JObject info { get; set; }  public string orderBy { get; set; }  public bool orderAscending { get; set; }  public string paging { get; set; }  public int rowLimit { get; set; }  public List\u003cstring\u003e fields { get; set; }  public Dictionary\u003cstring, object\u003e mappings { get; set; }  public string filter { get; set; }  public string filterBy { get; set; }  public string filterMode { get; set; }  public string signature { get; set; }   } Custom Connector Response public class CustomConnectorResponse  {  public string requestId { get; set; }  public string signature { get; set; }  public string encryptedSettingsPropertyBag { get; set; }  public byte[] iv { get; set; }  public QueryResult queryResult { get; set; }  } Response QueryResult public class QueryResult  {  public bool success { get; set; }  public string message { get; set; }  public JObject data { set; get; }  public List\u003cJObject\u003e items { get; set; }  public string resultCount { get; set; }  public string signature { get; set; }  } Retrieving URLs for Custom Connector settings When you have created the Test, Metadata and Query functions and your microservice is running, you should receive an output similar to the following shown using Azure functions:\nThese URLs will be used in the Connector Settings tab when creating the Custom Connector.\nWhat’s next  Once your Microservice is deployed, you are ready to start creating a custom connector go to steps to create a custom connector.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"What is a Microservice A microservice is a self contained independent …","ref":"/low-code/custom-connector/create-microservice/","tags":"","title":"Microservice Creation"},{"body":"Introduction You can generate excel workbooks within Kianda processes and populate the workbooks with data captured within each process instance. This could be useful, for example, when working with a lot of table data within Kianda. The add-in will automatically populate excel cells with the data from a table within your process. Each time value changes inside of a table, those values will be reflected in the Excel workbook every time you generate a new workbook.\nBefore you get started In advance of creating a template, you need to install Kianda add-in for word. Go to Installing Kianda add-in for Word or Excel and follow the steps of installation. You also need to create a template outline before starting, to learn more about what a template outline is, go to template outline.\nUsing the Kianda Add-in for Excel   On the right-hand side of the Home tab, click on the Kianda Add-in.\n  In the Kianda pane, log in using your Kianda username and password, select your subscription and press Continue.\n  Click on the process link button to get a drop-down list of Kianda processes that you have access to.\n  Select a relevant process and a relevant form that you want to create a template for.\n  Select a cell in the Excel workbook that you want to use to store the data from your process.\n  Select the Kianda form field you would like to add to the Excel template. For example Population table field in the Generate Excel form as shown below.\n  Click on at the bottom of Kianda task pane to add the form field into the template. Note that when you select a Table into the template, only the Title columns appear. This is because the add-in will look for all rows with the specific column name and insert the values into the excel workbook. See below for an example:\nWhen you add in the above table into Excel as a template smart tag, it will look as follows:\nThe resulting excel workbook of the above table and template is shown below:\n  Repeat steps 9 - 11 for as many form fields as needed and format the workbook as necessary.\n  Save the template. You can then add in the template as a File field within the process in Kianda.\n  List of field types accessible by Excel add-in You can use different types of input controls when creating your template for an Excel workbook, the images below represents the value pulled from the form into an Excel workbook for each of the input controls that are available in Kianda:\nExample form with all input controls in Kianda.\nExcel template used to represent all values from the above form.\nExcel workbook result for the example values from the above form.\n Text box control - retrieves the value from the text box into the cell that the smart tag was inserted. List control - retrieves the value from the list field into the cell that the smart tag was inserted. Number control - retrieves the value from the number field into the cell that the smart tag was inserted. Date control - retrieves the value from the date field into the cell that the smart tag was inserted. Table control - retrieves the values for each row inside of the table. Note that when the smart tag is inserted, only the column name is presented. File control - retrieves the name of the file that is stored in the file field, not the actual file therefore you cannot view any files that are retrieved from file fields. User picker control - retrieves the name of the user as a value. Toggle control - retrieves a No value when the toggle is turned off, and a Yes value when the toggle is turned on.  What’s next  With Kianda Excel add-in you can create templates which can be then used to generate dynamic Excel workbooks, to learn more on how to generate a Excel workbooks go to Generate excel workbooks.\nThere is a Kianda Add-in for Word that is added in the same way as the Kianda Add-in for Excel.

This rule forces the display mode to override the automatically calculated display mode of fields and forms.\nWhen to use You can add this rule:\n to a field to a form to a process (the rule will run on load)  How to get started To showcase the Field display mode in action, we will change the display mode of a user picker field to Read mode after a user has been chosen. To learn more about User picker field go to User picker control.\nTo implement the rule:\n  Click on an existing process by going to Administration \u003e Designer and decide which form, or field you will apply the rule to, by clicking on that item so that it is in edit mode so you can see the Edit/pen button, Pen button .\n  Click on Add a rule \u003e Form actions \u003e Field display mode.\n  In the Edit rule - Field display mode dialog box, give the rule a title in the Title field.\n  If you want to add conditions for the rule, click on the Edit conditions button to create conditions for the rule, see Conditions for more details.\n  To demonstrate how this rule works, we will add a condition to a field. Select the field you want the condition to be applied to. In this example it is the Employee field.\n  Select type of operator check to be performed on the condition. In this example it is the Not blank operator. Here we are checking whether the Employee field is Not blank.\n  In the Field or form option, select the field you want the Field display mode rule to affect. In this example it is the Employee field.\n  Choose from Edit mode or Read mode.\n Edit mode - allows the form or field to be edited. Read mode - sets the mode of a form or a field to Read-only.    Click on Add to add as many fields or forms as needed.\nThe video below demonstrates the Field Display mode rule in action, where the Employee field becomes Read mode after a user is selected. The Date field which was not editable changes to Edit mode after a user is selected. This is achieved by applying a condition to the Employee field. The condition checks if the Employee field is Not blank, therefore when a user has been selected this condition is valid, activating the Field Display mode rule.\n  Editing, deleting or duplicating rules When you have clicked on an existing rule, and the rule is visible in the right-hand pane under Rules, there are a number of options available to you.\n  To disable a rule click the slider across beside the rule name.\n  To copy a rule, click on the Duplicate button beside the rule name.\n  To delete a rule, click on the Bin/Trash button .\n  To view a rule, click on the rule name to open the Edit rule dialog box.\n  User tip   Form state (Edit / Read) will not be saved.

File upload fields can also be useful if you want a file to be generated from the information entered in a form or if you want a file to be sent as part of your process - see Rules for more information.\nFor example, in an Inspection process, you may want the user (an inspector) to be able to upload the details of their inspection as a PDF file or photos as they complete an Inspection Form; or you may want the Kianda system to generate a report based on the information in the Inspection Form and to email this as a PDF file to a supervisor.\nHow to get started   To add a File upload field to a form, first open the relevant process.\n  Select the form within that process that you want to add the field to (so that the Edit Form button is visible).\n  Click on Controls in the left-hand pane to expand the Controls menu.\n  Select Input to view the range of Input controls and click on File. A New field - File dialog box will open with a range of options you can choose from for your new File upload field.\n  Title: You can change the name of the File upload field from the default ‘File 1’.\n  Name - This is a unique name for the field and inherits a camel case version of the entered Title.\n  Help text: You can insert text to help the form user to complete the File upload field - if you add help text, a question mark icon will appear next to the field title and, if the user clicks on this, they will see the help text you have inserted.\n  Custom CSS class name - You can type the name of a CSS class to allow the File upload to inherit specific styles defined in the Global CSS file.\n  Save location: This is the location the file will be saved to. When you click on the Destination button, a Select datasource dialog box opens in which you can choose where to save the file(s):\nYou can choose to save the file or files to Kianda or to another external data source.\n  Open file behaviour: You can choose whether the file is downloaded or opens in an internet browser.\n  Folder structure: If you have chosen an external data source as the ‘Save location’ for the file(s) uploaded to the file upload field, you can then choose the folder structure you want to use for saving the files to that external data source.\n  Allow file override: You can choose whether or not to allow file override. If you choose ‘Yes’, if a user goes back into the form and uploads another file to the File upload field, this will override the original file they had uploaded. This option works in conjunction with the Allow uploading multiple files option - if you choose to allow multiple files to be uploaded, then the ‘Allow file override’ option is no longer relevant (as uploading more files will not override file/files already uploaded).\n  Allow remove file: If you select Yes, this allows the form user to come back into the form and remove the file they had previously uploaded, and another option appears - Remove and delete file: if you choose Yes, when the file is removed, it will also be deleted from the location where it was stored specified in the Save location; if you choose No, then only the reference to the file is removed from the form and the file remains in the Save location.\n  Allow uploading multiple files: Choose No to only allow the user to upload one file or choose Yes to allow the user to upload multiple files.\n  File name options: Choose whether to keep the original file name, to have the file name auto generated by the system, or to be based on a form field. If you choose From form field, another option appears - File name field - allows you to select a field representing the name of the file:\n  File extension: You can set/limit the type of file(s) that can be uploaded by inserting a specific file type. For example, if you insert .pdf in the File extension box, when the user browses for the file to attach, the file type will automatically be set to .pdf. If you want to allow any type of file to be attached, leave this option blank.\n  Enable media capture: If you choose Yes, this enables the user to capture media to upload - on a mobile device, when the user clicks on the Upload button their camera/video recorder will open (depending on whether you’ve selected the file extension to be image or video).\n  Button text: By default, the File upload icon has the text Browse, but you can change this here.\n  Button icon: By default, the file upload icon is but you can change this by clicking the Button icon drop-down menu and choosing a different icon from the large range of icons available.\n  Enable background upload: Select this checkbox to enable files to be uploaded using a background operation. This option is typically used in conjunction with the Enable chunked upload option.\n  Enable chunked upload: Select this checkbox to upload files using resumable chunks. This option can be useful if the file size is likely to be large or the network speed is likely to be slow.\nNote: If you select Enable background upload and Enable chunked upload there is an additional step you need to take to ensure that these upload options work. In your form, you need to select each field or button that has a Save process rule applied to it, click on that rule to open the Edit rule dialog box and select the Perform background save checkbox. Then click OK. This will ensure that the upload options you’ve chosen for your File upload field work as intended.\nFor example, you would need to select the ‘Save process’ rule attached to the ‘Save’ button in your form (by clicking on the Save button and then clicking on the Save process rule):\nThis opens the Edit rule - Save form dialog box - check the Perform background save option and then click OK:\nIf the Enable background upload and Enable chunked upload options are chosen and a user completes a form while they are in an area with poor coverage, once the user re-establishes internet connection they will need to go back into Kianda and click the Force refresh button at the top right of the Home page.\n Show uploaded files count: Select Yes to show the number of uploaded files.    Once you complete the New field - File dialog box and click OK, a new File upload field is added to your form, with the name you inserted as the Title in the dialog box (by default the title is File 1 unless you change it).\n  In the example of our Inspection Form, the new File upload field (titled Upload photos) added to the form could look like this when a user views it on a mobile phone (to see how your form or field will look on a mobile, view it in Mobile preview by using the Preview option which can be opened by clicking the play button icon ):\nHow to edit, move and delete File upload fields To edit a File upload field:\n Select the File upload field (by either clicking on the field title or on the field’s drag handle button ). Click on the Edit field button (Pen icon) .  The Edit field - File dialog box will open, enabling you to choose from the same range of options as appear in the New field - File dialog box (as already discussed in How to get started).  ​\tYou can make any changes you wish in this dialog box and then click OK to confirm.\nTo move a File upload field, simply:\n Select the field’s drag handle button . Drag and drop the field wherever you want to move it to within your form.  To delete a File upload field from your form:\n Select the field (by either clicking on the field’s name or its drag handle button ). Click on the Bin/Trash button . Click on OK to confirm.  How to edit File upload field properties To view or edit the field properties associated with a File upload field, select the field (by clicking on the field title or field drag handle button ) - the Field properties menu will appear in the right-hand pane.\nFor example, the Field Properties associated with a File upload field titled ‘Upload photos’ are shown here and include:\n Field type - The type of field, in this case a File field. Title - The Title of the field, in this case ‘Upload photos’. Show title - If this is selected, the File upload field title will be shown in the form. Required - If this is selected, the File upload field will be mandatory for the form user. Enabled - If this is selected, the user will be able to edit or interact with the field. Visible - If this is selected, the File upload field will be visible in the form. Layout - The width of the blue bar can be adjusted to change the width of the File upload field as it appears on a PC or mobile phone (to view the Mobile layout, click on the expand button to the right).  To learn more about the different options within the Field properties menu, go to Field Properties.\nSaving changes and version history Make sure to save any changes you make by clicking on the Save button . You will always have the option to revert back to previous versions of your form by clicking the Design Version History button in the top right corner.\nWhat’s next  Now that you’ve learned about the File upload control, find out more about the other types of Input fields you can add to a Kianda process:\n Date control List control Number control Table control Text box control Toggle control User picker control  ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"File upload controls (fields) can be inserted in a form if you want …","ref":"/platform/controls/input/file-upload/","tags":"","title":"File upload control"},{"body":"Introduction This rule implements the Read function which is one of the four CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Database) functions. The rule will read one or more items of data from a chosen data source, for example SharePoint, SAP or Oracle databases, see Data connectors for more details.\nThis rule is used to find an item from your data connections. To find an item, you could use a data source filter which acts as a conditional bridge between Kianda and data connections. If the condition is true, you could map the data source field or text to the Kianda form field.\nThis rule is used to perform a query and return data for use in the form.

It works on condition bases which allows you to pull wanted and unwanted data back into the process. To learn more about conditions go to Conditions.\n  Map results to table:\n  Yes - selecting this option will allow you to map results to a table and opens the following options below:\n Select a table - allows you to select a table from within your process which will be populated by mapping. This is useful when you want to display a lot of data from the datasource. Existing rows behaviour:  Override - will override any duplicate date therefore will keep the last duplicate inside of the table. Append - will add any duplicate data to the table and therefore all occurrence of data will be displayed in the table.   Enable server paging - enables the server paging configurations. For example if your data source has 10 row per page, enabling this option will force the table to have 10 rows per page.    No - selecting this option will only pull the first occurrence from your data source.\n    Results mapping - is used to set fields within your form from the datasource itself. To learn more about results mapping go to On Success Mapping.\n  On error mapping - you can expand this option by clicking on it, then add fields where you can display any error message that may have occurred during the mapping process.

Edit mode means that users can submit information, while read mode means that users can only view forms. The latter may be useful for example for certain staff to review feedback in a form, but not be able to edit/update it. Form owner: The default owner is the person or group that the form is assigned to when the the form is created. By default, only this person or group can edit the current form. All other users can only view forms in read mode. The default owner however can reassign forms to other individuals and/or groups. Current form: Typically there are several forms in a process, and only the form that has the status ‘current form’ is editable. However, in a complex multi-step process, other forms can be configured to activate with the current form, meaning they can also become editable at the same time, creating a form group.  These three considerations are established when the form is created, as seen in the dialog box below.\nNew form dialog box\nThese properties can also change dynamically as a result of rules being applied, see Rules.\nSetting display modes statically Remember forms in process instances are either in edit mode meaning they can be edited/changed or read mode where the details are visible to form users but cannot be changed. The actions below refer to making forms editable so if the actions below are not used, then the forms are in read mode. The actions below refer to static or fixed use, set when the form is first created or updated at a later time.\n  Forms in process instances will be editable for Default owner(s), that is the form owners defined when the form is created, or a form is edited. Form owners are defined in the New form/Edit form dialog box, shown in part 1 of the image above. When a process instance runs, the form owner can then edit the form in that instance.\n  By default the first form in a process becomes the current form, so only this form will be editable. However if several forms are activated with the current form when the form is created or edited in the New form/Edit form dialog box shown above, then all forms in that group will be editable by the form owner in a process instance.\n  By default the Submit mode for forms is Only this form meaning that when a process instance is running you can choose only that particular form can have details submitted or saved. Alternatively you can choose all forms in edit mode, meaning that several forms can have their details submitted or saved. For example if several forms are activated together and all are in edit mode then the details of all these forms can be submitted together in the database.\n  Forms can be statically set to allow Quick actions including allowing editing. When a form is created or edited using the New form/Edit form dialog box, clicking on Enable quick actions allows you to statically enable:\na) reassignment of forms\nb) editing of forms\nc) custom actions on any form\nFor a) and b) you can choose individuals and/or groups who can reassign or edit forms. In the case of b) edit there are options to hide form footer buttons when editing, and to trigger rules on save against a set field when saving edits.\nFor c) custom actions, you can set your own custom action and create an action label against a particular form field. This means that the user(s) assigning the custom action will see the labelled action designated for them. As a designer you can choose the action display mode as read-only, edit or both, so you can decide what type of access the user(s) will have.\n  Changing form display dynamically with rules If you use the Form action rule called Field display mode, you can change how a field or form displays dynamically. For example you have a condition set that the display will change based on the condition being present or not.\nWhen you add this rule, under Action you can choose a field or form and choose from Edit mode or Read mode.\nFor more information on this rule go to Field Display mode rule.\nOther rules can be used in other ways to change process workflow and therefore how forms behave. For example using the Assign form rule you can assign a form to a particular user, making them the form owner, and therefore giving them edit access to the form.\nWhat’s next  To read more about form ownership go to Form owner.

Forms contain all the buttons, fields, and rule triggers needed to execute your process.\nYou can use the Designer to design forms for end users who will use the platform to submit, save and review information, either as named users in the platform, users who receive a link to an anonymous form, or partners who can access shared processes. These end users will create new process instances or records in the system, or access existing process instances which shows information that has either been saved or submitted in a form.\nWhen discussing forms we’ll talk about form design that is creating and updating forms within a process using Kianda Designer as well form use which refers to end users who will edit or read forms in a process instance/record in the system, built using the Designer.\nForm design principles As you work with Kianda Designer you are designing the ‘user interface’ for users to interact with a particular process. Keeping the end user in mind, there are three design principles:\n  Reading modes: Form users can either use/access forms in edit mode or read mode. Edit mode means that users can submit information, while read mode means that users can only view forms. The latter may be useful for example for certain staff to review customer feedback in a form, but not be able to change/edit the feedback form.\n  Current form: Typically there are several forms in a process, and by default the first form in a process is the current form.\nFor example in the Training Attendance Process above, the process flow is as follows:\n  Training Request - an employee initiates a process instance by filling out this form\n  Training Approval - the manager approves the request using this form\n  Training Attendance - when training approval occurs, a trainer invites the employee to attend training and once complete, the trainer completes a this form to evaluate the employee’s participation.\nTherefore when a process instance is initiated upon submission of the Training Request form, then the next form in the process becomes the current form, in this case the Training Approval form.\nOnly the form that has the status ‘current form’ is editable by a form owner (see point 3 below). In a complex multi-step process, several forms can be configured to activate with the current form, meaning they are also editable at the same time, creating a form group, see section 2 of New form creation. Rules can also be used to change the workflow and make other forms the ‘current form’.\nAlso note that all first forms in a process flow add the current user as a ‘form owner’ therefore allowing all users to edit the first form, as clicking on ‘submit’ or ‘save’ in the first form results in a new process instance.\n    Form owner: The default owner is the person or group that the form is assigned to, this means they can edit the current form(s) in a process instance. Default owners are typically set when a form is created, see section 1 of New form creation below. By default, only this person or group can edit the current form in a process instance. All other users can only view forms in read mode. The default owner however can reassign forms to other individuals and/or groups. Form ownership can also be assigned dynamically using the Assign form rule.\n  These three considerations are established when the form is created, as seen in the dialog box below, and these parameters can be updated at any time by editing the form design. These properties can also change dynamically as a result of implementing rules, for example the Go to form rule can change the workflow in a process.\nNew form creation As mentioned above there are certain considerations to keep in mind when working with forms. The image below shows a New form dialog box that is created when the Add form button is clicked in Kianda Designer. At any time if you click on a form and then the Edit/pen button an Edit form dialog box appears which has the same parameters as the one shown in the image below.\nNew form dialog box\nNew form considerations  The Default owner(s) field is where you can set individuals and groups as the default form owners who can edit the form. Activate with means that the form can be activated with other forms within the process, so they can be edited at the same time. This means several forms become the current form in a form group. Submit mode means that when a process instance is running you can choose only this form to be submitted, or you can choose all forms in edit mode meaning that several forms could have their details submitted or saved. Enable quick actions allows you to statically enable a) reassignment, b) edit, and c) custom actions on any form. For a) and b) you can choose individuals and/or groups who can reassign or edit forms. In the case of b) edit there are options to hide form footer buttons when editing, and to trigger rules on save against a set field when saving edits. For c) custom actions, you can set your own custom action and create an action label against a particular form field. This means that the user(s) assigning the custom action will see the labelled action designated for them. As a designer you can choose the action display mode as read-only, edit or both, so you can decide what type of access the user(s) will have.  Related rules The following are rules that are directly associated with working with forms and form state.\n Go to form: This rule enables the designer to provide a way for users navigate to any form within the process. Assign form: This rule allows designers to dynamically change the default form owners of forms from user picker fields or other means. Submit form: This rule marks the form as complete or submited and allows the process to progress the workflow to the next available form. Field display mode: This rule forces the form display mode to be editable or read only even when the current user is not a form owner.

They are fields that can be used to enhance the layout of your form - for example, responsive panels, dialog boxes and rich text fields.\nGetting started with Layout fields  To insert a Layout field into a form, first open an existing process or create a new process by going to Administration\u003eDesigner in the left side menu. See Create First Process to learn how to create your first process.   Then select the form within that process that you want to add the Layout field to (so that the Edit Form button is visible).\n  Next, click on Controls in the left-hand pane to expand the Controls menu and select Layout to view the Layout fields.\n  Click on the Layout field you want to insert.\n  There are 4 types of layout fields:    Panel - The Panel field provides responsive panels to hold elements of your form like text boxes and lists and enables flexible layout options for better design. To learn more, go to Panel control.\n  Dialog - The Dialog field is used to create modal dialogs to alert or prompt form users. For example, a warning message could display to remind the user to complete part of a form before they proceed to the next section. To learn more, go to Modal Dialog control.\n  Richtext - The Richtext field is used to create rich content in forms, such as an attractive banner or static html, and provides optimum formatting options. To learn more, go to Richtext control.\n  Field group - The Field Group control can be used to mirror a group of fields from another form or location and reference those fields in your new form, making process design sleeker and more efficient. To learn more, go to Field group control.\n  How to add, edit, move and delete Layout fields How to add Layout fields To insert a Layout field into your form, click on the field type you want to add from the Layout menu.\nFor example, to add a new panel to your form, click on Panel - a pop-up message will appear saying ‘Field added’ and a panel field with the default name Panel 1 will be added to your form (by default, the title of the new panel will not be shown but you can make it visible by selecting the ‘Show title’ checkbox in the Field properties panel to the right).\nHow to edit Layout fields To edit whatever type of Layout field you have added to your form:\n  Select the field (by either clicking on the field name or on the Drag handle button )\n  Click on the Edit Field button (Pen icon) .\nIn our example, we have selected the Panel field by clicking the Drag handle button and can then click on the Edit field button to edit it.\n  This will open up the Edit Field dialog box where you can make various changes (such as changing the Title of the field) and where a variety of options will be available to you, depending on the type of Layout field you have selected.\n  How to move Layout fields To move a Layout field:\n Select the field’s Drag handle button  Drag and drop the field wherever you want to move it within your form  How to delete Layout fields To delete an input field from your form:\n Select the field (by either clicking on the field’s name or its Drag handle button ) Click on the Bin/Trash button  Click on OK to confirm  How to edit Layout field properties To view or edit the field properties associated with a Layout field, select the field (by clicking on the field title or drag handle button ) - the Field properties menu will appear in the right-hand pane.\nFor example, the Field Properties associated with a Panel field titled ‘Existing Qualifications’ are shown here and include:\n  Field type - The type of field, in this case a Panel.\n  Title - The Title of the field, in this case ‘Existing Qualifications’.\n  Show title - If this is selected, the field title will be shown in the form.\n  Required - If this is selected, the field will be a mandatory field that users must complete (denoted by a red asterix next to the field title).\n  Enabled - If this is selected, the user will be able to edit or interact with the field.\n  Visible - If this is selected, the field will be visible in the form.\n  Layout - The width of the field is denoted by the width of the blue bar. Click on the bar to change the width of the field as it will appear on a PC or mobile phone (to view the Mobile layout, click on the expand button to the right).\n  To learn more about the different options within the Field properties menu, go to Field Properties.\nSaving changes and version history Make sure to save any changes you make by clicking on the Save button . You will always have the option to revert back to previous versions of your form by clicking the Design Version History button in the top right corner.\nWhat’s next  We have briefly introduced each of the four types of Layout controls.

Using this rule you can also look up groups or partners by specifying one of the properties available. When looking up a user, group or a partner you can use the following properties:\n First Name Last name Display name Email Phone number Partner company name Partner main contact email Partner language Partner region UserId Custom profile attributes, to learn more about profile attributes go to Profile attributes.  When to use Use this rule when your process requires to filter a user using a profile property, for example, when a user fills out his email address, a user picker field is assigned with the user that matches the entered email address. This rule is used to automate a user picker field when property input is provided.\nYou can add this rule:\n to a field to a form to a process (the rule will run on load)  Before getting started In advance of using the Lookup user by property rule, in your process you need to have created at least one or more forms. The lookup user by property rule also requires a User picker field which is used to store the user that matches the property you have entered. For best practice, you can also create a text box field which holds the value of the property that you want to look by, for example the email address of a user.\n User picker (required) - field to store the user when the look up is performed.

However using this rule gives a greater degree of flexibility to cause an action based on user input using a Condition.\nTake the example of a feedback form, where there is an option for a customer to fill in their name or not. If they do fill in their name however, then a Customer Account Number field becomes mandatory.\nAs soon as Maddie fills out her name in the example above, then and only then the Customer Account Number becomes required, indicated by an asterix.

It works exactly like the Send email rule with three additional fields to which are used to set up the date and time of the meeting. The three additional fields are as follow:\n  Start time - indicating the starting date and time of the meeting.\n  End time - indicating the ending date and time of the meeting.\n  Location - indicating the location of the meeting.\n  If you are using an email connector, a meeting request will appear in the calendar of the receiver(s). Otherwise the meeting request will appear as a calendar file (.ics file type) attached to an email. to learn more about email connector go to Email connector.\nWhen to use You can add this rule:\n to a field to a form to a process (the rule will run on load)  Before you get started In advance of using this rule, you need to have created one or more forms, complete with control fields. For example a Text box control with an employee’s ‘Name’ may be part of a form ‘Meeting request’. Then this ‘Name’ field can be used as an expression in the email to send personalised emails, so these aspects must be set up in advance. The Meeting request rule must also contain three specific fields which are the Date control for both the Start and End time fields, as well as textbox control or a List control a field for the Location.\n Decide how the rule will be implemented, for example will an email be sent once a form is saved or submitted. In the example of form submit, then click on that form in the process \u003e Submit button \u003e Add a rule \u003e Send email. Decide who the automated email will be sent from, for example a no-reply type email. If you leave the From field empty, the email will be sent from noreply@kianda.com. If you want your email to come from a different sender, then go to Email connector for more details on how to set that up. Any email addresses to send To, From, CC or BCC must be set up in advance. This could be a textbox in a form called ‘Email address’ with a unique Name like ’emailAddress’, or it could be a user picker field associated with particular users, groups or partners. If you want to track the emails, then you must set up a field in your form to store email tracking. If you want to attach any files to an email, files must first be stored in a File field in one of the forms.   Note; the start and end time fields are both required on the request meeting rule therefore you should make the start and end fields required on your form too. To learn more about required fields go toControl properties.\n How to get started   Click on an existing process by going to Administration \u003e Designer and decide which form, or field you will apply the rule to, by clicking on that item so that it is in edit mode so you can see the Edit/pen button . For example selecting the Submit as shown below.\n  In the left-hand side pane, click on Add a rule \u003e Communications \u003e Meeting request rule.\n  In the Edit rule - Meeting request dialog box, fill out the following details:\n Title - of the email for example ‘Send meeting request’ Edit conditions - click on Edit conditions to set conditions for sending an email, for example while a process has a ‘status’ of ‘open’, send reminder emails. To learn more about conditions go to Conditions. Start time - select a pre-defined date field from your form. This is a required field. End time - select a pre-defined date field from your form. This is a required field. From - who the email is from, click on Person button and choose from the appropriate Selection mode, see Selection mode below.  Warning\nIf you add an email address to the From field, you must specify an Email connector, see Email connector. If a connector is not specified, the emails will come from noreply@kianda.com. If a Global SMTP connector is configured, all emails will be sent from the global connector.\n To - who the email is to, click on Person button and choose from the appropriate Selection mode, see Selection mode below. This is a **required **field. BCC - who will be blind copied on the email, as with To field. Subject - type in your email subject and click on the Ellipsis button to add an expression, go to Expression builder for more information. This is a **required **field. Body - choose from an array of styles and formats to create your email including Style, Colour, Font size, Remove font style, Font family, Unordered list, Ordered list, Paragraph, Table, Link, Picture, Attach a File and Code view. For example if you click on Code view button you can copy HTML code directly into the body text. This is a required field.  ​\tTo find out more about how to attach a file, see Attachments for more details.\n​\tTo add a message to your email, click on the Body text box. You can personalise automated emails using fields from the process by clicking on the Ellipsis button to add an expression, see Expression builder for more details.\n  Send via connector - options are a) No or b) Yes\n  If you choose Yes then you must choose an Email connector and decide if you want to Save Sent Items (Yes or No) which means sent emails are saved in a sent items folder in your email account. For more information go to Email connector   Note that if Global SMTP Mail connector has been configured, all emails sent will use the Global connector settings instead, including no-reply@kianda.como find out more, go to Setting up a Global SMTP mail connector.\n    Enable tracking - options are a) No or b) Yes\n  Note that this option is only available if Send via connector is set to No and the email is being sent from noreply@kianda.com.\n  If you choose Yes then you must click into the field under Field to store tracking event (Open, Click, Bounce, Spam) and choose a field from a form to store the event.\n   This option allows you to track the email after it is sent. All of these events, Open, Click, Bounce and Spam will be tracked.     Click on OK button when you are finished editing to save your changes or click on Close to exit the dialog box without saving.\n  Note when your rule is complete you may want to change the order of rules for the particular field or form that it has been applied to. Drag the new Meeting request rule to where you want, so the order of execution of rules is correct.\nFor example for a Submit button on a form I may want my Meeting request rule to be executed first before any other rule is executed. To do this click on the Submit button to make sure you are in Edit mode so that the Edit/pen button appears, and under Rules in the right-hand pane, drag the Meeting request rule to the top of the list by clicking on the rule and dragging it. For more information on rules, see Rules.\n  Email connector The Email connector is a mailing tool that allows you to send emails with a specified email account, for example support@ or info@. An email connector must be set up in advance, to learn how to do that go to Email connector.\nIf you leave the From field empty, the email will be sent from noreply@kianda.com. If you want your email to come from a different sender, follow these steps when you are editing the Meeting request rule:\n Set Send via connector to Yes. Click into the field under Email connector and select a connector. Click on OK button when you are finished editing to save your changes or click on Close to exit the dialog box without saving.  Note that if Global SMTP Mail connector has been configured, all emails sent will use the Global connector settings instead of what is specified in the send email rule. Go to Administration \u003e Subscription \u003e Subscription Details to check for a global setting or to find out more, go to Setting up a Global SMTP mail connector.\nSelection mode When you are filling out the To, From, or BCC fields and click on the Person button you have the following selection mode options to choose from:\n  Any user or partner\n  User(s) defined in a user field\n  Form owner(s)\n  Email address in a field.\n   Note; You can reset user/ field you selected by clicking Clearon the dropdown field in the Select email users dialog box.\n   Any user or partner - choose from Users, Groups and/or Partners in the drop-down list. All users must be predefined in the system, see Users and Groups for more details.\n  User(s) defined in a user field - choose a user picker field from the process, where the selected users, groups or partners will be assigned to the To, From or BCC respectively.\n  Click on the desired User field in your process to add to the Select a user field box.\n  Click on to add more selection fields.\n  Remove a field clicking on the Bin/Trash button\n    Form owner(s) - selecting this option allows you to click into the field under Form owner of selected form and choose from the forms within that process. This automatically uses the form owner(s) email address. To learn more about forms and form owners go to Form basics.\n     Email address in a field - With this option selected, by clicking into the field under Type the address or select from a field, you can either type in an email address manually or choose from a field within the process you are working in.  In all cases when you have made your selection, click on OK button to save your changes or click on Close to exit the dialog box without saving.\nExpression builder The expression builder is a useful and efficient way to use existing form fields as part of automated emails that you want to send out.\nFor example if you have a form Annual Leave request that contains a text box field ‘Employee Name’ you can use this field in an automated email to let a manager know that an employee has submitted a request.\n  Before you begin have your message inserted into the Body of the email and position your cursor where you want to add an expression, for example an Employee Name after ‘Your employee’ as shown below.\n  Click on the Ellipsis button on the right-hand side of the email Body. An Expression builder dialog box opens.\n  Click into the field under Add field to expression. Forms and fields that are part of your process appear where you can expand elements to drill down to find the field that you want, for example ‘Employee Name’. Click on the field to add field to the expression.\n  Click on the Add to expression button to add the field as an expression. Note that the expression is the Name(unique) of that field.\n  Click on OK button when you are finished editing to save your changes or click on Close to exit the dialog box without saving.\n  The result is the expression is now part of the automated email.\n  To add more expressions, firstly position your cursor in your body text where you want to add the expression, then click on the Ellipsis button and under Add field to expression clear any existing fields by clicking on the Clear button. This appears when you hover over the Add field box.\nThen search for other fields, for example lists or links, and use the Expression reference functions, see step 7.\n  Click on Reference to find out how to use particular functions in your email. For example ProcessLink() returns the html link to the current process. Copy this function into the Expression box and click on OK to add the function. Then in the Body type in the text you want associated with this link for example “click here” into the brackets of the function:\nIn this way you can build personalised automated emails that provide a link back to a process instance, for example that a manager can view, update or approve. For more information on References and Expressions see Expressions for more information.\n  Attachments To attach a file into the Send email rule, you must first contain a file field in your process. To learn more about file control go to File upload control.\n  To attach a file to an email, click on the Attach a file button . The Attach file to email dialog box opens.\n  Select a File field from your process to attach the file, for example an Image filed as shown in the image below.\n  Click in the File field, find and select the desired field.\n  Click on Insert attachment. There is an option to attach a link to the file rather than the file itself.\n  In the Attachments section of the Send email dialog box, the name of the File field will appear indicating that attachments will come from the specified field. You can delete the specified File field by clicking the red bin/trash icon.\nWhat’s next  To find out more about other communication rules go to Communication rules.\nTo find out more about other rules go to Rules.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"The Meeting request rule sends an email according to a predefined …","ref":"/platform/rules/communications/meeting-request/","tags":"","title":"Meeting request"},{"body":"Introduction When working with rules in forms, a key principle to consider is rule order. Rule order is important if there are multiple rules attached to an item like a button or form field to determine the sequence of rule execution. As a form designer, you can change the order of execution to suit your specific process design.\nRemember you can assign rules at:\n  Process level - onload rules that execute when a new process instance is initiated.\n  Form level - onload rules that execute when a form is submitted.\n  Button/field level - rules attached to buttons or fields within forms, or at the end of a form, for example a Submit button. An example of rule order is given at this level in the section below Rule order example.\n  Rules are typically synchronously executed in Kianda, so for example when using a Start a process rule, when the rule is executed first any mappings from a secondary/target process are mapped into a primary process, and from there if there are any rules to trigger on the secondary/target process those are executed, but a rule will only execute when the previous rule has completed. This is different to asynchronous execution where the system will execute rules without waiting for the previous rule execution to finish. Within time defined rules, like Start a process and Schedule a rule there is an option to choose between synchronous/in-series or asynchronous/in-parallel where the latter may be useful for rules without dependency.\nRule order example For example, you may want a process to send automated emails to a safety manager, where the email includes submitted form data. In this case a Send email rule could be attached to a form Submit button so an email is sent once the button is clicked. This will result in an automated email to a designated person. To generate a report of the completed form, you can use the Generate word document rule triggered again when the Submit button is clicked. In this example the Generate word document rule has to be executed before the Send email rule, so that the Word document can be generated and then attached to the email.\nThe rule order consideration is therefore particularly important when rules are dependent on each other - where the output of one rule is the input of another rule.\nChanging the rule order of multiple rules In the example below we will look at changing the rule order of a Send email rule attached to a Submit button. The Submit, Save and Close buttons by default already have Submit, Save and Close process rules attached, in order to allow form shutdown.\nTo change rule order, when the rule is created:\n Click on the item that has multiple rules attached, for example a Submit button. Remember by default Submit buttons in forms will have ‘form shutdown’ rules, namely Submit, Save and Close. Click on Rules in the right-hand pane, drag the Send email rule to the top of the list by clicking on the rule and drag it to the top of the list, before Submit, Save and Close rules.  The video below shows an example of a Send email rule being created and saved. The rule is attached to the Submit button. Once the rule is created, by default the new rule goes to the bottom of the list of rules. To move the rule, simply click on it and drag it to where you wish to place it. In this example we want the email sent before any of the shutdown processes like Submit or Save, but after a Generate Inspection rule, so the output from that rule can be used in the Send email rule.\nYour browser does not support the video tag.

Kianda is the most flexible low-code platform that you can use to create digital business processes. Kianda can be used in two ways:\n As a Designer or Administrator you can use the platform to design digital applications to drive your business. Prototypes can be built quickly and easily without the need for coding experience using Kianda Designer to create processes and forms to look and work the way you want. Choose from 16 predefined field types and 60 rules to create your forms within your processes. And if you don’t like those and have some coding experience, use the no-code part of the platform Kianda Developer to create customised field, rule and dashboard widgets. As a platform user, use the platform to input data, or gather and use data from external data sources like SharePoint or SAP, and then monitor process execution in a dashboard using seven widget types, from lists to chart, to get an at-a-glance overview of efficiencies or bottlenecks in your organisation. Forms and processes can also be shared with partner organisations or sent as anonymous links for third parties to complete.  How does Kianda work? The Kianda platform low-code platform is created with flexibility in mind, allowing simple user interactions to build complex processes.\nKianda has been constructed using an Model, View, Controller (MVC) approach (Model, View, Controller). This approach allows designers to build mobile-responsive applications via rapid User Interface (UI) prototyping. The UI provides an easy way to build an application by clicking, scrolling, and drag and drop of fields. The layout both provides a way to both build the application or process schema, and to capture and monitor data at run-time.\nWhat’s under the ‘hood’? The MVC approach enables user or system-supplied data captured through fields within forms, to react or trigger defined rules associated with fields, forms or processes, via the rules engine.\nThe Kianda rules-engine The Kianda rules engine consists of:\n Rule blocks - these are blocks that unlock specific functionality using a toolkit approach Flexible and declarative conditional logic  These two components (rule blocks and conditional logic) are used extensively and recursively by designers to build the required orchestration of actions or rules that interact with data to provide the required functionality for your apps or processes.\nThe rules engine, combined with conditional logic enables designers to build ambitious, progressive web applications or end-to-end digital business processes that offer both a great UI and high performance.\nIn addition to the rules engine, CSS3, HTML5, EmberJS, WebApi and NodeJS are some of the underlying technologies used within the platform.\n What makes Kianda great is the simplicity and unbounded flexibility it gives citizen developers and low-code developers alike when building web based process apps.   In summary the Kianda platform provides an ideal interface for rapid prototyping and delivering outcomes quickly.\n","categories":"","description":"Platform guides.

The following sections describe security at different levels.\nProcess security settings When you are creating or editing a process in Kianda Designer, you can set security settings for that process. This setting will apply to every record (instance) created from that process. To do this, click on the process in Designer and then, in the right-hand pane, click on the Settings button and select the checkbox beside Enable process security.\nChoose an individual user, groups or partner or combination, to be ‘security users’ and then choose from one of three security modes, as shown in here.\nProcess security settings\nThe three available security levels are listed from lowest to highest. For example, if you choose Security users only can create, view and update means that only the users listed as Process security users – in the example shown here, Mike Balcoome and the Management Team – will be able to access and view process records. No other users will have access to the process records generated by this process.\nProcess security rule Another way to set security is to use one of the Workflow rules called Process security to dynamically change the security settings for a process record (instance). Using this rule allows you to set the same security modes shown in the process settings above, but this can happen based on a particular condition or trigger – for example, clicking the Submit button.\nTo add this rule, open your process in Kianda Designer and select the relevant form. Then, in the left-hand pane, go to Add a rule \u003e Workflow \u003e Process security. In the Edit rule – Process security dialog box, create a condition if desired, and then choose from the type of users who will become security users. Choose from the options: Override to override existing security, or Append if you want to add a new level of access. Click the Enable security checkbox to choose a Process security mode.\nEdit rule – Process security dialog box\nPanel and button security In addition to process and form level security, you can set panel and button security by clicking on a panel or button within a form. Click on the panel or button of choice, click the Edit button (Pen icon) and choose Yes beside Enable security. Click on the Add security button to add users or groups to enable access to the button or panel.\nPanel security within the edit field dialog box\nDashboard security As an end user, when you login to Kianda, you are presented with dashboards and widgets for different processes. The dashboard is made of multiple widgets like tiles, charts, links and lists. Go to Dashboard to find out more about each widget type. You can set security at both a) dashboard level and b) widget level, see Widget security for more details. This section will deal with dashboard level security.\nDashboard level security can only be applied if you have the Administrator role to allow visibility of dashboards and widgets.\nTo apply security to dashboards:\n  Go to the existing dashboard page by clicking on Dashboard and the page name in the left-hand side menu.\n  Click the Edit button visible in the top menu bar.\n  Now in Edit mode, the Settings button is visible. Click on the Settings button.\n  The Edit dashboard page dialog box appears where you can find the Visible to user picker with an option to select Users and/or Groups.\n  Select the correct Users and/or Groups using the dropdown menu.\n  Make any other changes you need to the dashboard, see Dashboard for more details.\n  Click on OK when you are finished editing the dialog box or Close to exit the dialog box at any time.\n  Save the changes you make by clicking on the Save button at the top of the page.\n  Widget security Similarly, you can set the visibility for an individual widget on the dashboard like a tile, chart, or list, for example, if you want the dashboard to be visible to everyone and a particular chart on the dashboard only visible to management. This can be achieved by setting the visible to field to the management group as shown below.\nTo apply security to a dashboard widget:\n  Go to the existing dashboard page by clicking on Dashboard and the page name in the left-hand side menu.\n  Click the Edit button visible in the top menu bar.\n  Now in Edit mode, click on the Cog/settings button of the widget.\n  The Edit widget dialog box appears where you can find the Visible to user picker with an option to select Users and/or Groups. The example below shows the dialog box for a List widget.\n  In the Visible to field select the correct Users and/or Groups from the dropdown menu.\n  Click on OK when you are finished editing the dialog box or Close to exit the dialog box at any time.\n  Save the changes you make by clicking on the Save button at the top of the page.\n  What’s next  Now that you’ve learned about Process level security, find out more about other security access levels:\n Workspace security Single Sign-On Data residency  ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Introduction In addition to Workspace security that is setting levels …","ref":"/security/process-level-security/","tags":"","title":"Process Level Security"},{"body":"Kianda provides 60 predefined rules organized into various categories—including Workflow, Communications, and Data—so you can easily automate key tasks in your forms and processes. These out-of-the-box rules cover a wide range of scenarios, from sending notifications to manipulating data, managing files, interacting with SharePoint, and more. To learn about each category, simply follow the relevant links above.\nWhen you need functionality beyond what these predefined rules offer, Kianda’s low-code platform lets you build your own custom rule widgets. Because Kianda is built on open web technologies (CSS, JavaScript, and templating with Handlebars), you can apply your existing web development knowledge to create powerful, tailor-made logic. This ensures that you’re never limited by predefined options—you can innovate and adapt to your organization’s evolving business needs, all while working in a familiar development environment.\nWhy Create Custom Rule Widgets? While predefined rules handle many common use cases, your organization may have unique requirements that aren’t covered. For example, you may need a custom rule that:\n Integrates with a specialized external API, Applies advanced transformations to your form data before submission, Enforces specific business policies that evolve over time, or Dynamically updates fields based on complex conditions that fall outside existing patterns.  Custom rule widgets give you direct control over the logic that drives your automated processes. You’ll use standard web technologies—HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—within the Kianda platform, making it easy to write, maintain, and scale your custom logic as requirements change.\nHow to Get Started To build custom rule widgets, you need an Administrator or Developer role. If you’re unsure about your role, check out Users \u0026 Groups for details.\nOnce you have the right permissions:\n  Access the Developer Resources: Go to Administration \u003e Developer in the left-hand menu. This page lists all existing widgets, including field, rule, dashboard, and data connector widgets.\n  Create a New Rule Widget: Click New widget to open the widget creation dialog. Fill in the required details:\n Title: Give your widget a clear, descriptive name. Unique Id: Auto-generated from the title, but you can adjust if needed. Widget Icon: Select an icon that represents your widget’s purpose. Widget Type: Choose Rule for a custom rule widget.  Click OK to confirm. Your new widget will now appear in the Developer resources list.\n  Widget UI and Code: Open your new widget to see two tabs:\n Widget UI (Handlebars template): Defines the widget’s configuration UI within Kianda Designer. Here, you can add form fields, dropdowns, and other elements to help process designers configure the rule’s settings. Use Handlebars to dynamically bind data and handle user input. Widget Code (JavaScript): Implements the logic executed when the rule runs. Here, you’ll use JavaScript to manipulate process data, call APIs, set field values, or perform calculations.  By separating UI from logic, Kianda keeps your code organized and easy to maintain.\n  Example: Custom Warning Message Rule Below is an example that demonstrates how to create a simple custom rule widget. This widget allows a designer to set a warning message and choose a target field where the message will appear when the rule executes.\nRule Widget UI (Handlebars)\n\u003cdiv class=\"form-group\"\u003e \u003clabel class=\"control-label\"\u003eWarning message to display\u003c/label\u003e {{input type=\"text\" required=true class=\"form-control\" value=rule.settings.message}}\u003c/div\u003e \u003cdiv class=\"form-group\"\u003e \u003clabel class=\"control-label\"\u003eField to display warning message in\u003c/label\u003e {{field-picker process=process required=true allowText=false value=field.settings.field}}\u003c/div\u003e In this template, {{input}} and {{field-picker}} components let the process designer specify a message and select the field in the form that will display the warning. This empowers business users (or other designers) to configure the rule without writing code.\nRule Widget Code (JavaScript)\n{  execute: function() {  var rule = this.get('rule');  var process = this.get('process');  var field = process.findFieldByName(rule.get(\"settings.field.name\"));  var message = rule.get(\"settings.message\");   if(field) {  process.setField(field, message);  }  } } Here, the execute function is the core logic that runs whenever the rule is triggered in a workflow. It retrieves the configured field and message, then updates that field’s value. This logic is concise, relying on standard JavaScript patterns and Kianda’s built-in APIs to interact with process data.\nManaging Your Custom Rule Widgets After creating and saving your custom rule widget:\n  Edit or Delete: From the Developer resources page, you can edit the widget’s UI or code at any time. If a widget is no longer needed, you can delete it.\n  Version History: Restore older versions of your widget if necessary, ensuring you can roll back changes without losing previous work.\n  Use in Designer: Once finalized, your custom rule widget appears under Rules \u003e Custom when adding a rule in Kianda Designer. This makes your new logic available to any process designer in your organization.\n  Unlocking New Possibilities By creating your own rule widgets, you tailor Kianda’s automation capabilities to match your exact needs. Combine your JavaScript skills, CSS styling, and open web development experience with Kianda’s low-code environment to build a powerful library of custom logic. Over time, you’ll develop a suite of custom rules that streamline workflows, enforce business policies, and integrate with other systems—all while leveraging familiar standards and straightforward developer tools.\n Embrace Kianda’s open, flexible architecture to quickly deliver tailored business process automation. If you have any questions or need further guidance, explore the platform’s documentation or inspect existing widgets with the Ember inspector. With Kianda, experienced web developers can easily extend the platform’s rule system, enabling dynamic and evolving business processes with minimal friction.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Kianda provides 60 predefined rules organized into various …","ref":"/low-code/rule-widget/","tags":"","title":"Rule widget

connector for your organisation.\nNote: You must be have an Administrator or Developer role to create a custom connector.\nBefore you begin Please note before you begin that there are three key steps that need to be implemented in order to create and use a customised connector.\n  Microservice - create a microservice that will implement metadata, query and test functions, click on the Microservice link to get further details.\n  Use Kianda features to create and test your customised connector - use Developer to register a new connector and use Data sources to create a connector datasource for the newly customised connector.\n  Process - use the custom connector to bring data into a process and use the query hook to filter the data.\n  Register a new connector To create a new customised connector, follow the steps below:\n From the left-hand side menu, go to Administration \u003e Developer then within the Connectors panel click on New Connector.   In the Create Connector dialog box, add a Title and browse for an Icon URL for your connector. The Connector Unique ID is automatically generated by the system.\n  Make sure to copy the secret key to a safe location where you will find it as it will be needed later. You can do this by a) clicking on Download TXT which will result in the Secret Key being downloaded as a CSV file or b) clicking on Copy Key to Clipboard, then click on OK when done.\n  Ensure that this secret key is added to your Microservice code, see Encryption and Decryption sample code, where you need to replace the string in the GetSecretKey function as shown below:\n private static string GetSecretKey()  {  return \"{secret key generated from Kianda}\"; //REPLACE ME  }   After populating the initial dialog box, the next screen will show you the title of the connector and contains four tabs: Connector Settings, Settings UI, Settings Code and Query Code.\nThe details of these tabs are found in the following sections.\n  Connector Settings tab This is where the Connector Title and Icon can be changed. These details will be seen in the Data connectors function, once the customised connector is created.\nThe URLs for metadata, test and query can be edited here too. The Metadata, Test and Query URL’s can be populated when the microservice is created, see Create a Microservice link for more details.\nFor example when your Microservice is running you should receive an output similar to the following shown using Azure functions and use these URLs in the Connector Settings tab.\nTo save details click on Update, then click on Close to return to the Developer resources page.\nSettings UI tab The Settings UI sets the user interface for a customised data connector within the Data sources function, found within Administration in the left-hand pane. By default there is sample code in this tab.

Also note an Authorize button added in the code above which has an action ‘authorize’ which is handled by the code in the Settings Code tab.\nOther details on the screen above, like the name of the page Datasource details, Use Kianda Cloud Connect and buttons Test connection, Save, Security and Close are automatically part of the UI for customised data connectors. However, custom handlebars can be added for the settings of the connector datasource using code in the Settings UI tab, namely fields like Datasource Name and Client Key as shown in the image above. This principle works the same as Widget UI, which is seen when creating custom rule widgets or field widgets for example.\nSettings Code In a similar manner to creating custom rule widgets or field widgets where there are Widget code tabs, the connector widget has a tab called Settings Code which is used to create the JavaScript code for the settings UI.\nBy default there is code in this tab, for example the Authorize button shown in the Datasource details page above has an ‘authorize’ function which is the first segment of code below.\n{  actions: {  authorize() {  let clientId = this.get(\"datasource.settings.clientID\");  let redirectUri = 'https://app.kianda.com/index.html';  let scope = 'openid User.Read.All Directory.Read.All ';  var readWrite = this.get(\"datasource.settings.readwrite\");  if (readWrite === 'yes') {  scope += 'Directory.ReadWrite.All Group.ReadWrite.All User.ReadWrite.All Directory.AccessAsUser.All';  }  this.set(\"scope\", scope);  let guid = uuidv4();  let consentUrl = 'https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?' +  'client_id=' + clientId +  '\u0026response_type=code' +  '\u0026redirect_uri=' + redirectUri +  '\u0026response_mode=query' +  '\u0026scope=' + scope +  '\u0026state=' + guid +  '\u0026prompt=login';  var authWindow = window.open(consentUrl, '_blank', 'height=750,width=700,scrollbars=yes,location=yes');   try {  authWindow.focus();  } catch (e) {  $.notify('Error during authentication, please try again', {  status: 'warning'  });  }  var that = this;  var handleCallback = function (evt) {  if (that.isDestroyed !== true \u0026\u0026 evt.origin.indexOf('kianda.com') \u003e -1 \u0026\u0026 evt.data) {   let accessCode = evt.data;   let scope = that.get(\"datasource.settings.scope\");  let openid = that.get(\"datasource.settings.openid\");  that.set('datasource.settings.accessCode', accessCode);  that.set('datasource.settings.accessToken', null);  that.set('datasource.settings.refreshToken', null);  that.set('datasource.settings.authorized', false);  that.set(\"datasource.settings.scope\", scope);  that.datasource.save().then(function () {  that.sendAction('test', that.datasource);  });  }    window.removeEventListener('message', handleCallback);  };  window.addEventListener('message', handleCallback, false);  }  }   } Other aspects to note in this sample code are the datasource settings, for example datasource.settings.accessToken and datasource.settings.environment denoting that you can add whatever settings you want to the UI within the Datasources details page using this type of code. These settings could be then used in a Microservice to create an action based on a chosen setting.\nQuery Code When using a data source, all data sources will have built-in metadata, query and querySuccess functions to allow content searches, including metadata content or information about the content, such as title, author and creation date. The Query code tab contains the code needed for these three functions. Default code is provided to help you get started, see below.\n{  metaData(tree, datasource) {  return tree;  },  query(datasource, query, rule, process) {  return query;  },  querySuccess(datasource,rule,result,process) {  //this.get(\"dataservice\").mapSuccess(result,rule,process); //uncomment to use default mapping behaviour  return result;  } } The default code contains three hooks that allow you to tap in to a module to trigger certain behaviours or actions. These hooks are:\n metaData hook Query hook querySuccess hook  Click on each of the links above to see further details.\nIn Ember, bubbling will search for each of the actions in the code above, and if not found, then a default action is used, but if found the default is overwritten. This principle is useful when something is created multiple times which is the case when creating custom data connectors.\nMetadata hook The Metadata hook is where the return of the tree or metadata call can be altered for a chosen datasource used in Kianda form design.\nThe treeparameter as part of this hook is seen in the sample code snippet below.\n metaData(tree, datasource) {  return tree;  } An example of the tree structure is shown below.\nThe tree follows the structure that there is a root node, in this example Countries and Cities is the root. The tree can be customised by adding an icon and making nodes selectable.\n{  \"text\": \"Countries And Cities\",  \"name\": \"countriesAndCities\",  \"icon\": \"fa fa-database\",  \"selectable\": false,  \"nodes\": [  {  \"text\": \"Countries\",  \"icon\": \"\",  \"desc\": \"\",  \"nodes\": [  {  \"text\": \"Country Name\",  \"title\": \"Country Name\",  \"name\": \"countryName\",  \"type\": \"string\",  \"desc\": \"\"  },  {  \"text\": \"ISO Country Code\",  \"title\": \"ISO Country Code\",  \"name\": \"ISOCode\",  \"type\": \"string\",  \"desc\": \"\"  }  ],  \"fields\": [  {  \"text\": \"Country Name\",  \"title\": \"Country Name\",  \"name\": \"countryName\",  \"type\": \"string\",  \"desc\": \"\"  },  {  \"text\": \"ISO Country Code\",  \"title\": \"ISO Country Code\",  \"name\": \"ISOCode\",  \"type\": \"string\",  \"desc\": \"\"  }  ]   },  {  \"text\": \"Cities\",  \"name\": \"cities\",  \"icon\": \"\",  \"desc\": \"\",  \"nodes\": [  {  \"text\": \"City Name\",  \"title\": \"ISO Country Code\",  \"name\": \"cityName\",  \"type\": \"string\",  \"desc\": \"\"  },  {  \"text\": \"ISO Country Code\",  \"title\": \"ISO Country Code\",  \"name\": \"ISOCode\",  \"type\": \"string\",  \"desc\": \"\"  }  ],  \"fields\": [  {  \"text\": \"City Name\",  \"title\": \"ISO Country Code\",  \"name\": \"cityName\",  \"type\": \"string\",  \"desc\": \"\"  },  {  \"text\": \"ISO Country Code\",  \"title\": \"ISO Country Code\",  \"name\": \"ISOCode\",  \"type\": \"string\",  \"desc\": \"\"  }  ]  }  ] } This structure will result in the output as shown in the image below,\nQuery Hook The Query hook allows a query to the datasource to be customised. Parameters are passed into this function to allow customisation to happen. These parameters are: datasource, query, rule and process; sample schemas are available for each at the Sample schema link.\nIn the sample code below, the filter is obtained by drilling into the query conditions object. This is just one example of how the query can be customized before being processed, which is an advantage of using custom connectors. Take a look at the query schema for more information\n query(datasource, query, rule, process) {  if(query.conditions)  {  query.filter = query.conditions[0].conditions[0].arg2.value;  }  return query;  } This ties in with the query success hook which handles the result which is returned from the datasource, which can also be customized.\nQuerySuccess hook The idea of the query success hook is to be able to customize the response of a datasource query for example drill into a complicated json response based on a condition.\nquerySuccess(datasource,result,rule,process) {  // this.get(\"dataservice\").mapSuccess(result,rule,process); //uncomment to use default mapping behaviour  return result;  } Once the connector is created, the connector is available from the Data sources function under Administration, see Creating a datasource for details.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Introduction This section will detail how to create a new Custom …","ref":"/low-code/custom-connector/steps-to-create/","tags":"","title":"Steps to create a custom connector"},{"body":"A dashboard Tile widget allows you to display a count of instances.

Creating and Managing Rules Creating and managing rules in Kianda is a straightforward process that allows you to implement complex logic and dynamic behaviors in your process applications. This section will guide you through the steps of adding rules to controls, managing form submission rules, and configuring process load rules.\nAdding Rules to Controls Adding rules to controls is a fundamental aspect of creating dynamic forms in Kianda. Controls, such as text boxes, dropdown lists, and buttons, can have rules attached to them to define their behavior based on user interactions. Here’s how you can add rules to controls:\n Select the Control: Navigate to the form designer and select the control you want to add a rule to. Add the rule: In the left panel, find the and click on “Add a rule” to expand the section. Choose the Rule Type: Select the type of rule you want to add from the list of available rules. For example, you might choose a “Hide or Disable” rule to conditionally hide a control based on user input. Define Rule Conditions: Set the conditions that trigger the rule. Conditions can be based on field values, user properties, dates, and more. You can add multiple conditions and condition groups to create complex logic. Configure the Rule Action: Specify the action that should occur when the conditions are met. For example, if the rule is to hide a control, you will specify which control to hide. Save the Rule: Once you’ve configured the rule, click ok to apply the logic to the control.  Form Submission Rules Form submission rules are executed when a form is submitted and marked as completed using the “Submit Form” rule. These rules are crucial for performing final validations, calculations, or data operations before the form is finalized. To add submission rules:\n Access Form Rules: In the form designer, click on the form tab on the top to reveal the “Form submit rules” section under the properties panel. Add a Form Submission Rule: On the left panel click on “Add a rule” to expand the rules section. Rules added here should be executed upon form submission. For example, you might add a “Send Email” rule to notify a supervisor that the form has been completed. Define Rule Conditions: Similar to control rules, define any conditions that need to be met for these rules to execute. This ensures that the rules are only triggered under the appropriate circumstances. Save and Test: Save the rules and test the form submission to ensure that all logic is executed as expected.  The “Submit Form Rule” rules can be added to a submit button to initiate the submit form event.\nProcess OnLoad Rules Process load rules are executed when a process is loaded. These rules are useful for pre-loading data, initializing form fields, or performing any setup operations required when the users opens the process. Here’s how to configure process load rules:\n Open On Load Rules: In the process designer, click the title of the process on the top bar above the save button\". This will reveal the “On load rules” on the properties panel on the right. Add Onload Rules: Select “Add a rule” under left panel to expand the rules section. Choose the type of rule you want to execute when the process loads, such as “Find Items” to pre-load data into the form. Define Conditions and Actions: Set the conditions that trigger the rule and specify the actions to be performed. For example, you might set a condition to check if certain data is available before populating the form fields. Test the Process Load: Save the rules and load the process to verify that the onload rules execute correctly and the form is initialized as intended.  By mastering the creation and management of rules in Kianda, you can build highly dynamic and responsive process applications. These rules allow you to automate tasks, enforce business logic, and create user-friendly forms that adapt to various inputs and conditions, ultimately enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of your workflows.\nYour browser does not support the video tag.   4. Rule Conditions Rule conditions in Kianda provide the logical framework that determines when a rule will execute. These conditions are essential for implementing dynamic behaviors in your process applications, ensuring that actions are only taken when specific criteria are met. Understanding how to configure and use rule conditions is crucial for building robust and responsive process apps.\nOverview of Rule Conditions Rule conditions are the building blocks of logic within Kianda rules. They define the “if-then” scenarios that control the execution of actions in your process apps. Each rule can have an unlimited number of conditions, allowing you to create complex and nuanced logic. Conditions can be based on various factors, such as field values, dates, user properties, and more.\nCondition Groups and Conditions Rule conditions are composed of condition groups and individual conditions:\n Condition Groups: These act like parentheses in logical expressions, grouping multiple conditions together. You can define whether all conditions within a group must be met (AND logic) or if meeting any one condition is sufficient (OR logic). Individual Conditions: Each condition represents a specific logical test, such as checking if a field equals a certain value or if a date falls within a specified range. These conditions form the criteria that must be evaluated to determine whether a rule should execute.  The conditions visual editor provides a visual editor in the process designer that enables developers easily author conditions for use in many logical scenarios.\nHere is an example JSON representation of rule conditions:\n\"condition-groups\": [{  \"group\": \"and\",  \"conditions\": [{  \"operator\": \"eq\",  \"arg1\": {  type: \"field\",  name: \"field1\"  },  \"arg2\": {  type: \"text\",  value: \"text\"  }  }] }] The above is only for illustration, developers use the visual conditions editor above to achieve the desired conditional logic.\nExample of Rule Conditions Consider a rule designed to hide a specific form field based on user input. The rule might include conditions that check if a text box contains a certain value. If the condition is met, the field will be hidden. This is an example of a hide/show rule with conditions:\nAvailable Condition Operators Kianda provides a wide range of condition operators to support various logical tests. These operators can be used to compare values, evaluate dates, check for patterns, and more. Here are some of the available condition operators:\n Date Operators:  Is Today Is Before Today Is After Today Is This Week Is Previous Week Is Next Week Is This Month Is Previous Month Is Next Month Is This Year Is Previous Year Is Next Year Is Between Dates   General Operators:  Equals (eq) Not Equals (neq) Contains (contains) Greater Than (gt) Greater or Equal (gte) Less Than (lt) Less or Equal (lte) Is Blank (isblank) Not Blank (notblank) Matches Pattern (match) Does Not Match Pattern (nomatch) Is Visible (isvisible) Is Enabled (isenabled) Is Current User or Member (IsUserOrMember)    Configuring Rule Conditions To configure rule conditions in Kianda:\n Select the Rule: Navigate to the rule you want to configure within the form or process designer. Edit Conditions: Click on “Edit conditions” to open the conditions editor. Add Condition Groups: Define your condition groups and specify whether they should use AND or OR logic. Add Conditions: Within each group, add individual conditions using the available operators. Specify the field, value, or property to be tested. Save and Test: Save your conditions and test the rule to ensure it behaves as expected under the defined criteria.  By leveraging rule conditions, you can create highly dynamic and responsive process applications in Kianda. These conditions allow you to implement precise control over when and how rules are executed, ensuring that your business logic is applied correctly and efficiently.\n5. Workflow Rules Workflow rules in Kianda are designed to manage the flow and state of forms and fields within your process applications. These rules help control visibility, required status, navigation between forms, assignment of forms, and more. Understanding and utilizing these rules effectively can significantly enhance the functionality and user experience of your process apps.\nHide or Disable The “Hide or Disable” rule is used to control the visibility and interactivity of forms and fields based on specific conditions. This rule can hide, show or disable, enable elements dynamically, ensuring that users only see and interact with relevant parts of the form.\n Use Case: Hide a section of the form unless a checkbox is checked.  Make Required The “Make Required” rule forces a field to be mandatory based on certain conditions. This ensures that users provide necessary information before proceeding.\n Use Case: Make an email field required if a “Contact Me” checkbox is checked.  Go to Form The “Go to Form” rule sets a specific form as the current form within a multi-form process. This rule helps navigate users through different steps or stages of a process.\n Use Case: Direct users to a summary form after they complete the initial input form.  Assign Form The “Assign Form” rule assigns a form to one or more users, enabling dynamic assignment based on certain criteria. This is useful for workflows that require different users to complete different parts of the process.\n Use Case: Assign a review form to a manager if the total expense exceeds a certain amount.  Process Security The “Process Security” rule allows you to enable or disable process security dynamically. This rule helps in managing access and permissions based on specific conditions.\n Use Case: Enable additional security for sensitive forms.  Start a Process The “Start a Process” rule initiates a new process based on certain conditions. This rule can automate the initiation of related processes, ensuring seamless workflow integration.\n Use Case: Start an approval process when a new request is submitted.  Schedule a Rule The “Schedule a Rule” allows you to automate actions at specific times or intervals. This rule is useful for recurring tasks or timed actions within your process.\n Use Case: Send a reminder email every Monday morning.  By effectively utilizing workflow rules in Kianda, you can create dynamic and responsive processes that adapt to user inputs and automate essential tasks. These rules ensure that your forms and processes are intuitive, efficient, and aligned with your business requirements.\n6. Communication Rules Communications rules in Kianda are essential for automating interactions and keeping stakeholders informed throughout your process applications. These rules enable you to send emails, meeting requests, alerts, and create anonymous form links, ensuring seamless communication and collaboration. Understanding how to configure and use these rules will enhance the responsiveness and efficiency of your processes.\nSend Email The “Send Email” rule allows you to automatically send emails based on specific triggers or conditions.

See Date control for more information on using date fields.\nHow to get started   Click on an existing process by going to Administration \u003e Designer and decide which form, or field you will apply the rule to, by clicking on that item so that it is in edit mode so you can see the Edit/pen button, Pen button .\n  Click on Add a rule \u003e Dates \u003e Compare dates.\n  In the Edit rule - Compare dates dialog box, give the rule a title in the Title field.\n  If you want to add conditions for the rule, click on the Edit conditions button . See Conditions for more details.\n  Under Action \u003e Compare dates, create one or more actions for the rule by filling out the following:\n  Date to compare - choose a date field from the drop-down list to serve as the date you would like to compare. This date will be placed before the comparison function.\n  Compare to date - choose a date field from the drop-down list to serve as the date you would like to compare to the initially selected date (Date to compare). This date will be placed after the comparison function.\n  Compare function - Choose from the radio buttons:\n  Is between dates - checking this button displays a new field Compare from date, where you must select a start date field from the drop-down list, as well as choosing a Compare to date from the other drop-down list (end date). This function returns true or false if the Date to compare falls within the start and end dates selected.\n  Is before date - checking this button determines if the selected date for the Date to compare field falls before the selected date for the Compare to date field.\n  Is after date - checking this button determines if the selected date for the Date to compare field falls after the selected date for the Compare to date field.\n      Under Action \u003e Result:\n  Destination field - choose the field within your Kianda form where you would like to store the resulting boolean value of the comparison function. As can be seen in the below example, you can utilise the result as a status checker using a destination text field.\n  Value when true - if the result of the comparison function is true, enter what string of text you would like to return to your form.\n  Value when false - if the result of the comparison function is false, enter what string of text you would like to return to your form.\nThe resulting value can be used in a Kianda Condition to control other parameters. See Conditions for more details.\n    Finally, clicking on the OK button will save the new rule you have just created and apply it to the chosen field.\n  Editing, deleting or duplicating rules When you have clicked on an existing rule, and the rule is visible in the right-hand pane under Rules, there are a number of options available to you.\n To disable a rule click the slider across beside the rule name. To copy a rule, click on the Duplicate button beside the rule name. To delete a rule, click on the Bin/Trash button . To view a rule, click on the rule name to open the Edit rule dialog box.  User tip  Selecting the Compare to date function displays an additional field where you can select two different dates, and determine if your Date to compare is within.\nThe resulting boolean value can be used within other Kianda Conditions.\nWhat’s next  To find out more about other date rules go to Dates.\nTo find out more about other rules go to Rules.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Introduction The Compare dates rule is utilised to compare two date …","ref":"/platform/rules/dates/compare-dates/","tags":"","title":"Compare dates"},{"body":"Controls (commonly called fields) are predefined field widgets that allow you to add specific elements to your forms and processes, such as lists, text boxes, buttons and tables. There are 16 types of controls (fields) you can add to a form - see the controls list below for details.\n   Category Field Name Purpose     Input Text box Allows users to enter text. Help text and placeholder options guide users when filling out a form.    List Displays info as dropdown, radio, multiselect or checkbox lists. Users select values from these lists.    Number Allows users to enter numbers as integers, currency, or percentages.    Date Allows users to enter dates, with options for default date, user time zone adjustment, and data display.    File Allows file upload with options like override, multiple file uploads, and file deletion.    Table Enables data entry in table format with options to add/remove rows and sorting/searching.    User picker Lets users choose from a predefined set of users/groups/partners. Supports selection mode for single or multiple users.    Toggle Allows a user to slide a toggle or check a checkbox, with preassigned values based on user input.   Layout Panel Creates an area for fields. Panels can be used to create sections within a form and be visible only to specific users.    Dialog Creates a pop-up dialog box prompting users for information.    Richtext Creates text with formats, images, and links that can be displayed in forms.    Field group Mirrors a group of fields already created, allowing for easier form linking and reuse by process designers.   Actions Button Creates custom buttons with various display/control options, including security settings for specific users.    Link Creates a hyperlink for users to click, with options to open in a new or the same tab.    Image Allows images to be added to forms.    Signature Adds electronic signatures with options for authentication or manual/drawn signature uploads.    If you have developer skills, you can create your own custom field widget - see Development for more information.\nGetting started with Controls If you go to Administration \u003e Designer and click on an existing process or create a new process and then select a form within that process so that the Edit Form button (Pen icon ) is visible, the predefined fields you can add to forms are found in the left-hand pane.\nNote: By default, three buttons are automatically added to any new form created - Submit, Save and Close (as shown in this form canvas image).\nThere are three categories of controls (fields):\n Input - There are eight types of Input fields. These include the most commonly used data fields such as text box, user picker, date field, table, checkbox, drop-down and number field. See Input for more information. Layout - There are four Layout fields that serve the purpose of perfecting the layout of your form. They include responsive panels, dialog box, field groups and rich text fields - see Layout for more information. Action - There are four Action fields that allow user interface actions like buttons, links or even signature components - see Actions for more information.  If you develop custom fields, they will be available to form designers under a fourth category of controls called Custom.\nAdding, moving and removing controls To start adding controls or fields to a form:\n  Select the form you want to work on so that the Edit Form button (Pen icon ) appears.\n  Click on a Controls category (Input, Layout or Action) and control type in the left-hand pane. For example, you could choose the Input category and select Text box to insert a text box into your form.\n  To move a control, click on the Drag handle button .\n  To remove a control from your form, select the field you want to remove, then click on the Bin/Trash button and click on OK to confirm removal.\n  Editing controls All controls/fields will have edit options when you start creating the field, as well as Field properties that you can edit to tailor the field (control) to make it work the way you want. Each field can also have rules applied to it to make your processes dynamic.\nTo edit a control:\n  Click on the added control, so that the Edit button (Pen icon ) appears.\n  Then click on the Edit button itself so that the edit control dialog box appears, for example as shown with the textbox control below.\n  Fill out the fields within the dialog box as necessary. All controls need a Title from which a Unique Name is auto-created. This Unique ID is used in expressions to create automated emails for example.\nAdditional syntax can be added to the Unique name to attribute customised styling, see User tips.\n  The remaining fields within the dialog box will depend on the type of control implemented, where different fields and values can be selected, see Controls list for a full set of controls. Links available at the end of this page will also bring you to each control category and from there you can find out what each parameter means for each control type.\n  Control customization with CSS If customised styling has been applied in a Global CSS file, available to administrators under Administration \u003e Developer, then these attributes can be applied to controls by entering the desired class name into the Custom CSS class name field, as shown below.\nIn the example above, redField is defined in the Global CSS file as follows:\n.redField{  background-color: red;  color: white;  border-radius: 15px;  padding-bottom: 18px;  padding-top: 18px;  padding-right: 15px; } When applied to a textbox in forms, a particular colour border with padding is applied to the field, as well as white font colour, as seen below:\nGo to Global CSS file for more details.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Controls (commonly called fields) are predefined field widgets that …","ref":"/platform/controls/","tags":"","title":"Controls"},{"body":"Introduction This rule implements the Create function which is one of the four CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Database) functions. The rule will create one or more items of data from a chosen data source, for example SharePoint, SAP or Oracle databases, see Data connectors for more details.\nThe Create item rule allows you to create an item of any type in the specified data connector. When applying this rule, you must select a data source in which you want to create the item. When the data source is connecter, you can map inputs from your form fields into your source. Also, you could map a data source field or text back to Kianda on success or store an error message on failure.\nWhen to use You can add this rule:\n to a field to a form to a process (the rule will run on load)  How to get started   Click on an existing process by going to Administration \u003e Designer and decide which form, or field you will apply the rule to, by clicking on that item so that it is in edit mode so you can see the Edit/pen button, Pen button .\n  Click on Add a rule \u003e Data \u003e Create item.\n  In the Edit rule - Create item dialog box, give the rule a title in the Title field.\n  If you want to add conditions for the rule, click on the Edit conditions button , see Conditions for more details.\n  Click on Select data source button to select the data source you want to create a new item in.

This rule can be used to extract data from a data source and use this information in a Kianda form. Take an example of an Employee Onboarding or New hire process, where a user chooses a country for a ‘Country’ field from a drop-down list.\nThe drop-down list is populated using a SharePoint list in this example, and the ‘Country’ field in turn uses a Find item rule to populate the table below it in the form.\nThe section below introduces each of the Data rules.\nGetting started with Data rules If you go to Administration \u003e Designer and click on a process or create a new process, then click on Add a rule the Data rules are found in the left-hand pane when you click on Data.\nThere are five types of Data rules as follows:\n  Create item - The create item rule is used to create an item on your data connection. This is a straightforward rule which allows you to connect to your data source and map inputs. You can also map a data source field or text back to Kianda on success or store an error message on failure.\n  Delete item - To delete an item from your data connection, you could use a data source filter and map data source field or text from a data connection to Kianda form field.\n  Update item - This rule works in the same way as the Delete item rule. At any point, if you would like to update any item on your data connection, use this rule. To find an item to update, you could use a data source filter and map the input fields or text.\n  Find items - Use this rule together with a datasource to perform a query and return data for use with the form. To find an item, you could use a data source filter which acts as a conditional bridge between Kianda and data-connections. If the condition is true, you could map the data source field or text to the Kianda form field.\n  Set form field - This rule is used to update the value of fields in a form. The field value could be simple text or based on a custom expression with the ability to define JavaScript expressions. Use this rule to copy content between fields or to apply a custom expression to set the value of a given field.\n  What’s next  We have briefly introduced each of the five types of Data rules. Click on the links below to find out more about each rule in detail.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Data rules is the category of rules that enables the flow of data …","ref":"/platform/rules/data/","tags":"","title":"Data rules"},{"body":"One of the data connectors within Kianda that you can connect to is DocuSign. DocuSign enables organisations to manage electronic agreements by offering electronic signatures also know as eSignatures. eSignatures are a way to sign different types of documents electronically on many different devices.\nWhen to use You can use the DocuSign data connector when a process you have created requires you to send individual documents or envelopes to get them signed electronically. With the connector, you can access different types of templates that you have created within your DocuSign account, download documents, and access already existing envelopes to see their status or summary.\nBefore you get started In advance of using the DocuSign data connector, you must have an account with DocuSign. This account is used to authorise a connection between your Kianda subscription and your DocuSign account itself, so that the DocuSign Application Programming Interface (API) can be used. There are two types of accounts that you can create in DocuSign. An ordinary account and a developer account. Take note which account you have created as this information will be used to create a different connection within Kianda.\nHow to get started   From the Kianda home page, click on Administration \u003e Data sources.\n  Click on + Add new button and choose DocuSign from the list of data sources provided.\n  You will be automatically brought to the DocuSign details page, where you can start setting up the connection.\nChoose from the edit options:\n  Display name - type in the name for your DocuSign connector. This is used to distinguish between different data connectors on your platform.\n  DocuSign Environment - indicates which environment you have your account created in. There are two types of accounts that you can create in DocuSign. A developer account and an ordinary account. If you have an ordinary account and you are trying to connect to DocuSign, you need to select the Live option, and if your account is a developer account, then select the Demo option. This is important as the authentication of the account is different for those two types of account.\n  Demo - indicates that your DocuSign account is a developer account.\n  Live - indicates that your DocuSign account is an ordinary account.\n    Authorize - allows you to authorize the connection with your DocuSign account and Kianda. When you click this button, a DocuSign window will open allowing you to log in into your DocuSign to authenticate your account.\n    When you have added File system details, you are ready to test your connection and add security. At the bottom of the File system details page, click on Test connection button and if the service has been correctly configured, then you should receive a notification saying Connection test succeeded.\n  Click on Save to save the connection and you will receive a notification saying Details saved successfully.\n  Add Security settings by clicking on the Security button, go to Setting security for data sources for more details.\n  Click on Close to close the details page and return to the data source management main view.\n  DocuSign functions When you use the DocuSign data connector within Kianda, there are default functions that are invoked from DocuSign’s API. These functions enable you to access a number of DocuSign’s functionalities. You can use each DocuSign function by using the Data set of rules, to learn more about Data rules go to Data rules. With each DocuSign function you use, data needs to be passed into the function know as payload and data is also returned, known as response. When using the Data rules, you are presented with Input mapping which is equivalent to the payload. This is used to pass data into the function, for example when you need a document signed, you need to pass in a document file to be signed, in other words, the document file you pass in is the payload. The Results mapping is equivalent to the response, this is used to populate your form fields when a DocuSign function returns data, for example status of an envelope.\nHere is a list of all functions available when using the DocuSign data connector. To learn more about the payload and response for the available functions go to the DocuSign API Reference.\n sendDocument - allows you to send one or more documents to a recipient to get them signed. sendEnvelope - allows you to send a document to a recipient using one of your DocuSign templates. listTemplates - retrieves the templateID and templateName of all templates from your DocuSign account. getEnvelope - retrieves information from an envelope using an envelopeID. getEnvelopeSummary - retrieves a summary of an envelope using an envelopeID. listEnvelopeDocuments - retrieves any documents that are contained within an envelope using an envelopeID. downloadDocument - allows you to download a specific document using a documentID from an envelope using an envelopeID. listTemplateSigners - retrieves the name, role and recipientID of all signers from a template using a templateID. getSigningUrl - retrieves a URL to a signature made on an envelope using an envelopeID.  Example use case of DocuSign function Take the function listTemplates as an example. The listTemplates function returns (response) an ID and the Name of all templates that you have created in your DocuSign account. To use this function effectively, you can use the Find items rule in combination with the table input. The Find items rule will access all templates and map the results into the table. For each template in your DocuSign account, the Find items rule will add a table row with the appropriate Template IDs and Template Names of each template.\nTo showcase the functionality explained above, we will apply the Find items rule to a button; however, it can be applied to a form field, a form or a process (the rule will be executed when the process loads). Each time we press this button, a table will be populated with a list of Template IDs and Template Names from our DocuSign account.\n  Create a button in your process, to learn how to create a button go to Button control.\n  Create a table with two columns and call them ID and Name. To learn how to create a table and add columns go to Table control.\n  Apply the Find items rule to the button by following the steps from Find items rule. When following the steps of the Find items rule, make sure to do the following:\n Select the Map results to table option and select the table you created. This way the Find items rule will create as many rows as there are templates in your DocuSign account. The listTemplates function does not require any payload (Input mapping), so delete all fields from the input mapping section. Select listTemplates as your data source from your DocuSign connector. Select the appropriate column field from your table and results field from your data source in the Results mapping section.

ProcessLink() is a function that will return a link to that process instance. Using the expressions above in an email will mean that every time an instance of the process runs, the values will be presented in an automated email, creating greater efficiencies and personalising the email for the recipient.\nGetting started with expressions – example Email body text Expressions are recognisable in Kianda from the Expressions button found in Edit rule dialog boxes and other menu items, such as enabling quick actions for processes and number fields.\nWithin rules, expressions can be created using the Expression builder where you can Add field to an expression or use the handy Reference guide to get a list of commonly used functions.\nExpression builder\nLet’s look at an example of using an expression in the Body section of an email being sent using the Send email rule:\n  First, add a Send email rule to a form or forms, field or fields by selecting Add a rule \u003e Communications\u003e Send email from the left-side pane.\n  Type in any text that you want in the email Body and position your cursor where you want to add the expression.\n  On the right of the Body section of the email, click on the Expressions button .\n  The Expression builder dialog box appears.\n  Click on the blank box under Add field to expression and find the field you want to reference in your email, for example, a text box with a name ‘EmployeeName’.\n  Click Add to expression. The result is that the field appears in the Expression box.\n  Click OK to add the expression to the email body text, or click on Close to exit the dialog box without making changes.\n  To add additional field expressions, click on the Expressions button again, under Add field to expression, click on X beside the field name to clear the expression box and then search for the desired field from a form.\n  To add a function, click on Reference and copy the function into the body of the email. A list of references are available below.\n  Expression functions All JavaScript expressions and functions can be used in the Expression builder to create the impact you want, see Javascript expressions for more details.\nIn addition to defining your own expressions there is a set list of expressions found under References, see table below for meaning.\n   Expression Function     +, -, /, * Performs one of the basic mathematical operations: add, subtract, divide or multiply.   Sum(arg1, arg2, …) Returns the sum of the arguments listed between the parentheses.   Date(arg1) Converts the argument into a date.   DateAdd(dateArg, day, month, year, hour, min) Adds time to a given date. The date is stored in dateArg and the time to be added is stored in the day, month, year, hour and min arguments.   Status() Returns the status of the current process.   ProcessID() Returns the ID of the current process.   FormOwner(formName) Returns the form owner(s) for the given form.   FormCompleted(formName) Returns the date completed for the given form.   Pad(value, size, symbol) Adds left padding to the value with the symbol provided.   QueryString(parameter) Returns the URL query string for the given parameter (or an empty string if undefined).   IsOnline() Returns “yes” or “no” depending on the status of the online connection.   ProcessLink() Returns the HTML link to the current process The link text can be added between the parantheses e.g. ProcessLink(“click here”). This expression is for use in emails and rich text fields.   Digest() Returns a summary of changes to fields in the current process. A table will be given with the original and new values.   Digest(‘fieldName1’,‘fieldName2’) Returns a summary of the changes for the given fields. See note below.   GetFieldText(‘fieldName’) Returns the text in the given field. See note below.   GetFieldValue(‘fieldName’) Returns the value in the given field. See note below.    Note: In the case of the last three expressions, you should select a field which contains data.

As mentioned in Form basics, by default the first form in a process is the current form. Once submitted, control passes to the next form and the user is not allowed to go back to the previous form. The Go to form rule allows you to redirect the user to any form. The user can then navigate back and forth between those forms.\nWhen to use This rule can only be added to a button.\nWarning!\n The Close form and Go to form rules cannot be applied to the same button as both rules control which form comes next.\nThe Save form rule must be used and must appear before the Go to form rule in the list of rules.\n How to get started To dynamically redirect a user to a form:\n  Click on an existing process by going to Administration \u003e Designer and decide which form, or field you will apply the rule to, by clicking on that item so that it is in edit mode so you can see the Edit/pen button, Pen button .\n  Click on Add a rule \u003e Workflow \u003e Go to form.\n  In the Edit rule - Go to form dialog box, give the rule a title in the Title field.\n  If you want to add conditions for the rule, click on the Edit conditions button to create conditions for the rule, see Conditions for more details.\n  Under Action, create one or more actions for the rule by filling out the following:\n  Select form - click on the field and select a form from the process.\n  Display mode - choose from:\n  Auto - the display mode will be either edit or read as determined by the system.

Note there are 11 rules attached to that button so the order of execution is important, go to Multiple rules to learn more about how to change rule order.\nThe next section will cover how to use the buttons visible in the right-hand pane to manipulate the rule.\nEditing, deleting or duplicating rules When you have clicked on an existing rule, and the rule is visible in the right-hand pane under Rules, there are a number of options available to you.\n  To disable a rule, click the slider across beside the rule name.\n  To copy a rule, click on the Duplicate button beside the rule name.\n  To delete a rule, click on the Bin/Trash button .\n  To view a rule, click on the rule name to open the Edit rule dialog box.\n  What’s next  To find out more about other workflow rules go to Workflow.\nTo find out more about other rules go to Rules.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"The Go to form rule is used to control how a user moves between forms. …","ref":"/platform/rules/workflow/go-to-form/","tags":"","title":"Go to form"},{"body":"A dashboard Rich Text widget can be used to create custom rich text content on a dashboard page, such as an attractive banner or heading. It can provide optimum formatting options, such as bold and italics and the option to insert images or links.\nHow to get started To add a Rich Text widget to a dashboard:\n  Open the relevant dashboard page. To learn how to create your first dashboard page, go to How to create a dashboard page.\nFor this example, we’ll open a dashboard page called ‘Annual Leave’ that currently only has a List widget on it:\n  Click on the Edit current page button from the top dashboard menu to go into Dashboard Edit mode (in which the Widget menu, Settings button , Bin/Trash button and Add layout container button are available):\n  Click on the Rich Text widget button in the Dashboard Widget menu.\n  The Add widget dialog box opens with a range of options for your new Rich Text widget.\nChoose the options you want:\n  Title - You can insert the title you want for your Rich Text widget. In our example, we’ll call it ‘Information’.\n  Layout columns - You can choose how wide you want your Rich Text widget to be. You can choose from 1 to 12 columns in width by clicking on the blue bar. For example click half-way across the blue bar to create a widget that is 6 columns wide, or click on the right of the blue bar to create a column that is 12 columns wide.\n  Colour scheme - You can choose from six colour options for the header of the widget (Navy, Green, Blue, Amber, Red or White).\n  Show header - You can choose whether or not you want the header of your Dashboard widget to be shown.\n  Visible to - You can determine who will be able to see the Rich Text widget. You can select single or multiple Users or Groups, or a combination of the two. You can select Users or Groups in the right-hand menu so that the options shown in the drop-down list are either individual users or Groups.\nTo find out more about pre-defined Groups on Kianda, go to Users \u0026 Groups.\n  Note - Dashboard page security: When a dashboard page is first created, the users(s)/group(s) who will be able to view the dashboard are selected in the ‘Visible to’ option in the Create dashboard page dialog box (see Step 3 in How to create a Dashboard page).\nYou can also edit or update this setting at any point to change who has permission to view a particular dashboard page. This higher dashboard-level security setting will take precedence over the security settings (‘Visible to’) that are applied to the individual widgets within the dashboard (such as the Rich Text widget, in this case).\nSee Dashboard security and Widget security for more information.\n    Layout container - This option will only display if you have already created layout containers for your Dashboard page. Here, you can select which layout container you want your new Link widget to be placed in.\nA layout container is a simple way to organise, arrange and move the widgets you add to your dashboard. To learn more about layout containers, go to How to add layout containers to a Dashboard page.\nIn this example, we can select to place our new Rich Text widget into one of three layout containers - Top, Middle or Bottom:\n  Device visibility - You can choose what devices and types of internet connections the dashboard Rich Text widget will be visible on - select all the options you want from Desktop, Tablet, Mobile, Wi-Fi and Flight mode as to when the device can view the dashboards. By default, all options are selected.\n     Click on OK when you’ve completed the Add widget dialog box.\n  An Edit content dialog box automatically opens:\n  Insert the content you want to appear in your Rich Text widget by using the available options.\n  Insert the text you want to appear in the body of the Edit content dialog box. You can choose from an wide array of styles and formats, including: Style, Colour, Bold, Underline, Remove font style, Font size, Font family, Unordered list, Ordered list, Paragraph, and Table.\n  You can also choose to insert a Link or Picture or to switch to Code view (if you click on Code view button you can copy HTML code directly into the text).\n  If you click on the Picture button you will be redirected to the File storage area where you can search for existing images stored in the Kianda file system, you can also create a folder, upload or delete a file.\n  For our example, we will insert text details relating to the Annual Leave dashboard, format them as we want, and also insert a suitable image:\n  Click on the OK button when you are finished inserting the content you want in your Rich Text widget or click on Close to exit the dialog box without saving.\n  Your Rich Text widget will now be displayed on your dashboard. Click on Save in the dashboard top menu to save the insertion of the new widget.\n  How to edit Rich Text widgets To edit a Rich Text widget on a dashboard:\n  In the dashboard, click on the Edit current page button in the top menu to view the page in Dashboard Edit mode (in which the Widget menu, Settings button and Bin/Trash button are available).\n  Click on the Rich Text widget’s Update configuration (Edit) button .\n  The Edit content dialog box opens, enabling you to make whatever changes you want to the content of the Rich Text widget using the same range of options as outlined in Step 6 of How to get started.\n  Making the changes you want and then click OK.\n  The updated Rich Text widget will be shown on the Dashboard. Click on Save in the dashboard top menu to save the changes you’ve made.\n  How to move Rich Text widgets To move a Rich Text widget on a dashboard:\n On your dashboard, click on the Edit current page button in the top menu to go into Dashboard Edit mode. Select the widget’s drag handle button . Drag and drop the widget where you want it to go on your dashboard. Click on Save in the dashboard top menu to save the changes you’ve made.  In our example, we could move the new Rich Text widget to the left of the List widget:\nHow to delete Rich Text widgets To delete a Rich Text widget from your dashboard:\n  On your dashboard, click on the Edit current page button in the top menu to go into Dashboard Edit mode.\n  Click on the widget’s Remove widget (Bin/Trash icon) button .\n  A Delete widget dialog box will open. Click on OK to delete the widget (or click on Cancel if you wish to cancel the deletion).\n  Click on Save in the dashboard top menu to save the changes you’ve made.\n  How to edit Rich Text widget settings To update or edit your Rich Text widget settings:\n  On your dashboard, click on the Edit current page button in the top menu to go into Dashboard Edit mode.\n  Click on the Update widget settings (Cog) button .\n  The Edit widget dialog box will open, enabling you to make changes to any of the available options (the same options as were available in the Create widget dialog box discussed in Step 4 of How to get started).\nIn our example, we could choose to make increase the width of the Rich Text widget to be 7 columns wide, by clicking to the right of the existing blue bar.\n  Click on OK to confirm the changes you’ve made to the widget settings (or click on Close if you don’t want to retain any changes).\n  The updated Rich Text widget will display on your dashboard.

This rule creates a profile for the partner as well as shares a process specified in the rule. You can choose to generate an invite link and store the link in a text box field if needed instead of sending out an automatic email.\nWhen to use Use this rule when inviting a third-party organisation from within a process instance, for example when your company must hire a third-party organisation to complete a specific task from your process, you can share this process with the third-party organisation to complete the task. Take a maintenance company for example, a process is created to perform a maintenance check. The maintenance company performs a check but some broken parts need to be re-manufactured, therefore the maintenance company sends out a Partner invitation to the manufacturing company in order to manufacture missing or broken parts as the maintenance company makes checks and fixes but not manufacture parts.\nYou can add this rule:\n to a field to a form to a process (the rule will run on load)  Before getting started Before you get started with this rule, you need to create a shared process instance of the process you intend to share with the partner. To learn more how to create a shared process instance, go to Shared processes.\nIn advance of using the Invite partner rule, in your process you need to have created at least one or more forms. The Invite partner rule also requires you to create a list of fields that are used to hold information about the partner and which process you want to share. See below for the list of fields required in your process before using the invite partner rule:\n Partner organisation - text box field representing the name of the organisation that the partner is part of. Shared process name - text box field representing the name of the process you want to share. Contact first name - text box field representing the first name of the partner you want to share a process with. Contact last name - text box field representing the last name of the partner you want to share a process with. Contact email - text box field representing the email address of the partner you want to share a process with. Partner country - text box field representing the country that your partner is situated in. Partner city - text box field representing the city that your partner is in.  How to get started   Click on an existing process by going to Administration \u003e Designer and decide which form, or field you will apply the rule to, by clicking on that item so that it is in edit mode so you can see the Edit/pen button, Pen button .\n  Click on Add a rule \u003e Users \u003e Invite partner.\n  In the Edit rule - Invite partner dialog box, give the rule a title in the Title field.\n  If you want to add conditions for the rule, click on the Edit conditions button see Conditions for more details.\n  Under the Action section fill out the following:\n  Partner organisation - field representing the name of the organisation that the partner is part of.\n  Shared process name - field representing the name of the process you want to share. Note that this name needs to match the name of the Shared process instance and not the name of a process. For example if your subscription has a process called Maintenance check, you need to create a shared process instance and give it an appropriate shared process name, for example Maintenance check - Plumbing Partner. In this field you need to use the Maintenance check - Plumbing Partner as the name.\n  Contact first name - field representing the first name of the partner you want to share a process with.\n  Contact last name - field representing the last name of the partner you want to share a process with.\n  Contact email - field representing the email address of the partner you want to share a process with.\n  Partner country - field representing the country that your partner is situated in.\n  Partner city - field representing the city that your partner is in.\n  Partner logo - text box field representing the URL of the partners logo or a file field with the uploaded logo.\n  Send invite email - radio list representing whether to send an email to the partner. If No is selected an extra field appears:\n  Field to store invite link - field used as a container to store the generated invite link.\n    Partner account - a user picker field used to specify the account of the partner. You can pre-create an account for your partner and set this field with his user. This will prevent the invited partner to create an account when accepting the invite link.\n    When you are finished editing the dialog box, click on OK or click on Close at any time to exit the dialog box.\n  Editing, deleting or duplicating rules When you have clicked on an existing rule, and the rule is visible in the right-hand pane under Rules, there are a number of options available to you.\n To disable a rule click the slider across beside the rule name. To copy a rule, click on the Duplicate button beside the rule name. To delete a rule, click on the Bin/Trash button . To view a rule, click on the rule name to open the Edit rule dialog box.  User tip  Prior to inviting a partner, create a shared process instance of a process that you intend your partner to use. Give it a unique name for example use the original process name followed by the partners name. If you have a process called Inspection Checklist and your partners name is Windmill Inspections, call your shared process instance Inspection Checklist - Windmill Inspections. This will help you differentiate between your original process and the shared process.\nWhat’s next  To find out more about other User rules go to User rules.\nTo find out more about other rules go to Rules.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Introduction The Invite partner rule allows you to dynamically send …","ref":"/platform/rules/users/invite-partner/","tags":"","title":"Invite partner"},{"body":"List fields (controls) can be manually entered into a form or can be linked to from an external site like SharePoint. There are different display options - from drop-down lists to checklists - as well as other options (like the ability to make a list field mandatory for a user to complete).\nFor example, you could insert a list field in your form that will show a drop-down list of Types of Training that is maintained on SharePoint. The advantage of linking to an external data source like this is that your list will stay up-to-date with any changes made to the list on SharePoint.\nHow to get started   To add a List field to a form, first open the relevant process.\n  Select the form within that process that you want to add the field to (so that the Edit Form button is visible). If you want to add the List field to a panel within your form, first select the panel by clicking on it and then add the List field.\n  Click on Controls in the left-hand pane to expand the Controls menu.\n  Select Input to view the range of Input controls and click on List. A New field - List dialog box will open with a range of options you can choose from for your new List field.\n   Title - You can change the name of the List field from the default title List 1. For example, if you are working on a Training Request form, you may want to insert a List field to contain the types of training and may choose to title this ‘Type of Training’.\n  Name - This is a unique name for the field and inherits a camel case version of the entered Title.\n  Help text - You can insert text to help the form user to complete the List field. If you add help text, a question mark icon will appear next to the field title and, if the user clicks on this, they will see the help text you have inserted. In this example, the list field is titled ‘Type of Training’ and has associated help text:\n  Custom CSS class name - You can type the name of a CSS class to allow the List to inherit specific styles defined in the Global CSS file.\n  List source - You have three main options in terms of the source of the choices that will appear in your List field:\na) Entered manually\nb) Form data\nc) Data source\nWe will look at each of these three list source options in turn.\nIf you select the Entered manually checkbox, you must then manually type the choices you want to appear in your list into the List source box. Three default choices are shown - simply replace these with the choices you want to appear in your list (keeping the same format of one choice per line). You can insert more than three choices.\nIf you select the Form data checkbox (so the source of your list options is a form field), then the box under List source will now show the instruction ‘Select a form field…’ and two further options will appear below this - Display field and Value field.\nClick into the List source box and select the form field you wish to use as your List source and then choose a Display field (the field used to display values) and Value field to specify how you want to map the values from your data source into your list field.\nSelect the Data source checkbox if you want to use an external data source as the source for the choices to appear in your list:\nThen click on the Datasource button to open the Select datasource dialog box and choose the data source you want to connect to - for example, SharePoint. From there you can drill down into the datasource tree and select a specific data item to pull into the list. For more information on how to connect to data sources in Kianda, go to Data connectors.\nOnce you’ve selected a data source, click OK - a range of new options will now be shown below the Datasource button in the New field - List dialog box.\nSelect the Display field, Value field and a field to Sort by (the ‘Sort by’ option appears once you’ve selected a data source). As the datasource chosen in the example is a Kianda process, the fields will appear as form fields. Once you’ve chosen a field to sort by, an additional option - Direction - appears, enabling you to choose to sort values in Ascending or Descending order. In the example shown here, Kianda has been chosen as the data source and a field titled ‘Type of Training’ from a form called ‘Training Request’ has been chosen as both the Display field and Value field.\nClick on the Edit conditions button if you want to add a condition to your List field - for example, if you want to create a cascading list where the options available in a second list are dependent upon the option the user has chosen from a first list. To learn more about applying conditions, go to Conditions and to find out more about creating cascading lists, watch the video on How to create cascading dropdown lists.\nIf you choose Kianda as the data source for your list field, two additional options will be displayed - Query any process (checks all processes within Kianda for the field you have selected as the source for your list) and Query type (you can select anything created by or assigned to a particular user).\nOnce you’ve selected your List source and the various options associated with it, complete the remaining options in the New field - List dialog box:\n  Enable offline cache - You can choose this option to make list data available when offline (only available for lists with less than 500 options). This can be useful if you know you are going to be working in areas with poor connectivity such as remote environments with known dead zones.\n  Display format - You can choose to have your list field appear as either a Drop-down list, a Radio list, Multi-select or a Checkbox list.\nBy default, the Dropdown list radio button is selected, along with two additional options - Filter mode (you can choose either ‘Starts With’ or ‘Contains’) and Enable native selector on mobile (so a user completing the list field on their mobile phone can use the default list selector on it).\nIf you choose Radio list or Checkbox list you can choose a List display position of either Vertical or Horizontal.\n  Once you complete the New field - List dialog box and click OK button, a new List field is added to your form, with the name you inserted as the Title in the dialog box (by default, the title is List 1 unless you change it).\n  If we take the example of a Training Request form with a list field that contains the different types of training a user can request, the list field (which is titled ‘Type of Training’ and has a drop-down list format) could look like this when a user views it on their mobile phone:\nTo see how your form or field will look like on a mobile, view it in Mobile preview by clicking the Preview button (play icon) after first saving your changes.\nHow to edit, move and delete File upload fields To edit a List field:\n Select the field (by either clicking on the field title or on the field’s Drag handle button ). Click on the Edit field button (Pen icon) .  The Edit field - List dialog box will open, enabling you to choose from the same range of options as appear in the New field - List dialog box (as already discussed in How to get started).\nYou can make any changes you wish in this dialog box and then click OK to confirm.\nTo move a List field, simply\n Select the field’s drag handle button . Drag and drop the field wherever you want to move it to within your form.  To delete a List field from your form:\n Select the field (by either clicking on the field’s name or its drag handle button ). Click on the Bin/Trash button . Click on OK to confirm.  How to edit List field properties To view or edit the field properties associated with a List field, select the field (by clicking on the field title or field drag handle button ) - the Field properties menu will appear in the right-hand pane.\nFor example, the Field Properties associated with a List field titled ‘Type of Training’ are shown here and include:\n Field type - The type of field, in this case a List field. Title - The Title of the field, in this case ‘Type of Training’. Show title - If this is selected, the List field title will be shown in the form. Required - If this is selected, the List field will be mandatory for the form user. Enabled - If this is selected, the user will be able to edit or interact with the field. Visible - If this is selected, the List field will be visible in the form. Layout - The width of the blue bar can be adjusted to change the width of the List field as it appears on a PC or mobile phone (to view the Mobile layout, click on the expand button to the right).  To learn more about the different options within the Field properties menu, go to Field Properties.\nSaving changes and version history Make sure to save any changes you make by clicking on the Save button .

These widgets give you the building blocks you need to create informative, interactive dashboards that help end users understand the state of their processes in real-time. The existing 7 predefined widgets include:\n Richtext Tile List Chart Filter Link Walk-through  While these widgets cover many common needs, there may be times when you want a custom dashboard element—something that fetches specific data, applies unique formatting, or interacts with the user in a specialized way. Kianda’s low-code platform lets you create custom page widgets using open web technologies you already know, like CSS, JavaScript, and Handlebars. By leveraging these familiar tools, you can display large datasets, integrate external APIs, or design dynamic user interactions with minimal friction.\nWhy Create Custom Dashboard Widgets? Predefined dashboard widgets provide a quick, no-code way to visualize process data. However, your organization might have unique reporting requirements or require more complex interactions that are not fully addressed by the standard widgets. Custom dashboard widgets allow you to:\n Display large or complex datasets in a tailored format that meets your business needs. Integrate with external services or APIs, pulling in real-time data for end users. Enhance user interaction with custom buttons, filters, or drill-down features. Maintain a consistent brand experience, applying custom CSS or layouts to match your company’s style.  In short, custom dashboard widgets give you full control over the data presented to end users, enabling you to deliver clear insights and improve decision-making processes.\nGetting Started with Custom Page Widgets To develop custom dashboard widgets, you need the Administrator or Developer role. For details on roles and permissions, see Users \u0026 Groups.\nOnce you have the appropriate privileges:\n  Access the Developer Resources: In the Kianda main menu, go to Administration \u003e Developer. This page shows all widgets—field, rule, dashboard, and data connectors—in one place.\n  Create a New Widget: Click New widget to open the widget creation dialog. Enter:\n Title: A clear name that describes what your widget does. Unique Id: Automatically generated from the title but can be adjusted. Widget Icon: Choose an icon that best represents your widget. Widget Type: Select Widget for a dashboard widget.    Define the Widget UI and Code: After saving, you’ll see two tabs for your widget:\n Widget UI (Handlebars template): This defines the widget’s appearance and how users interact with it. You can create settings views for configuration and runtime views for end-user interaction. For example, you might add text inputs, dropdowns, or buttons that trigger custom actions. Widget Code (JavaScript): This is where you implement your logic. You can fetch data from external sources, manipulate the DOM, handle user events, and create dynamic content that updates in real time.  Example Dashboard Widget UI:\n{{#if (eq displayMode \"settings\")}}\u003c!-- Configuration view: Let users set up the widget --\u003e \u003cdiv class=\"form-group\"\u003e \u003clabel class=\"control-label\"\u003eYour Message\u003c/label\u003e {{input type=\"text\" value=widget.settings.message class=\"form-control\"}}\u003c/div\u003e {{else}}\u003c!-- Runtime view: Display data to end users --\u003e \u003cdiv class=\"col-sm-12\"\u003e \u003ch2\u003eWelcome {{widget.settings.message}}\u003c/h2\u003e \u003cbutton class=\"btn btn-sm btn-primary\" {{action \"customAction1\"}}\u003eAction 1\u003c/button\u003e \u003cbutton class=\"btn btn-sm btn-default\" {{action \"customAction2\"}}\u003eAction 2\u003c/button\u003e \u003c/div\u003e {{/if}}Example Dashboard Widget Code:\n{  actions: {  customAction1: function() {  // Implement logic for Action 1  },  customAction2: function() {  // Implement logic for Action 2  }  } } In this example, the configuration view (displayMode “settings”) lets an administrator set a message. The runtime view uses that message and adds interactive buttons. In your own widget, you could replace these controls with a data visualization, a list of records, or any other output that suits your requirements.\n  Manage Your Widgets: Back in the Developer resources view, you can:\n Edit: Update the widget’s UI or code. Delete: Remove widgets you no longer need. Version Control: Restore previous versions if you make changes you want to roll back.    Use the Widget in Your Dashboard: Once saved, the custom widget appears in your dashboard pages. Administrators can:\n Go to Home and Create a new page or edit an existing dashboard page. Click Edit current page to reveal the widget menu. Select your custom widget from the dropdown menu.  With the widget now placed on the page, adjust settings, connect it to data sources, and customize the display. Check Edit dashboard page settings for more details on configuring your page.\n  Unlock New Insights Through Custom Dashboards By building custom dashboard widgets using familiar open web technologies, you can surface the exact data and interactions your users need. Whether you’re integrating an external reporting service, displaying aggregated metrics from multiple processes, or providing an interactive interface for exploring large datasets, custom widgets put you in the driver’s seat.\nKianda’s low-code approach blends the speed and ease of drag-and-drop configuration with the flexibility and power of full web development. As a result, you can quickly create dashboards that go beyond static charts and tables—delivering dynamic, user-friendly interfaces that help your team make better, data-driven decisions.\n Embrace Kianda’s flexibility, leverage your CSS and JavaScript expertise, and start building custom dashboard widgets that enhance your organization’s insights and performance. If you need more guidance, explore the provided links, refer to the Ember inspector for debugging, and use your existing web development skills to make the most out of Kianda’s low-code platform.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Kianda provides several predefined dashboard widgets that make it easy …","ref":"/low-code/page-widget/","tags":"","title":"Page (Dashboard) Widget Development"},{"body":"Introduction The Remove table row rule allows you to remove rows within a specified table.

They offer easy reporting, permissions management, quick build, condition-based filtering amongst other features. For details on how to get started with dashboards go to Dashboards.  Create shared processes and attach dashboards to share   When the dashboard that you want to share within your B2B portal has been created, then you can control access by two means: a) Using the Shared Processes feature within Invite partner within Administration and b) within the B2B portal itself.\n  To implement a) go to Administration \u003e Invite partner and within the Shared processes section, click on Share a process.\n  Type in a Title and Instructions for partner, click on the plus symbol to add a selected process design to share.\n  Then click on the dropdown list to search for a process to share.\n  Click on the tick symbol to add the selected shared process.\n  Click on the Add partner group button to add a group from step 3 and click on Dashboard template to add the desired Dashboard (from step 4) to share. Security can be set on this dashboard so that only a defined group can see the dashboard - click on the field under Dashboard security to add in a named ‘partner group’ to enable access to this group only.\n  Add as many shared dashboards and partner groups as needed using the previous instructions. In addition the level of access for each shared process can be controlled through system settings. Click on the on the tick symbol to change the shared processes details, and then click on the Cog/Settings button and edit the details within the Process properties dialog box, for example as shown for a Training Request process below.\n  Within the Process properties dialog box you can check radio buttons for:\n Allow partner to create a new process instance - choose from Yes or No. If you choose Yes, then you are allowing invited partner(s) to create new process instances from the chosen shared process design. A field Partner user group allowed to create new instances appears, where you can define the group(s) in the partner organisation, that can create these new process instances. If you leave the field blank, then anyone in the partner organisation can create process instances. Allow partner delete a process instance - choose from Yes or No. If you choose Yes, then you are allowing invited partner(s) to delete new process instances from the chosen shared process design. Partner user group allowed to create new instances- choose from the Partner user groups that you created previously. By selecting a group here this dictates who can enter the process. Thus, defining a sub set of your B2B Portal users which can interact with that specific process. Partner process form visibility mode - choose from Assigned or All forms. If you choose Assigned, then the invited partner(s) can view only assigned form versus all forms, if All forms is chosen.    When you are finished editing the dialog box, click on OK, or else click on Close to exit the dialog box at any stage.\n  Data access at a datasource level When a process is shared within the B2B portal, you may choose to include one or more of your datasources. You may not wish to share all records from the datasource within the B2B portal, so you can limit access within the datasource itself. B2B Security can be enabled with the following datasources:\n Active Directory Docusign Dropbox Email File system FTP Global Payments Google Drive MySQL Office 365 Oracle PowerShell REST Service Salesforce SAP SharePoint SQL Server SOAP Service    Go to Administration \u003e Data sources.\n  From the Datasource management main view, click on a data source that has already been created with a status of ready, by clicking on the name of the data source, or create a new Data source by clicking on Add new, see Data sources for more details.\n  In the Data source details screen, click on the Security button .\n  In the Security settings dialog box, complete the fields as shown on screen, starting with Connection administrators.\nConnection administrators - only users or groups listed here are allowed to modify the connection settings. Click on the dropdown list to choose Users and/or Groups. If you leave the field blank, all Administrators and those users with the Manage datasources role can edit the connection.\n  Complete the field for Connection users. Only users or groups listed here are allowed to query data using this connection. Click on the dropdown list to choose Users and/or Groups. If you leave the field blank, any user can query data within the datasource.\n  Check/Uncheck Enable B2B. If you check the checkbox, this allows B2B external users to query the connection. The Enable partner default query parameters checkbox appears.\n  Check/Uncheck Enable partner default query parameters. If you check the checkbox, you can define default query parameters that are applied to any partner originated query. Parameters defined here take precedence over any design time queries. Click on Add mapping to choose a query type and table/operation as follows:\n  Query type - choose from Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD). These CRUD operations allow you to create, read, update and delete records within your datasource.\n  Table/Operation - click on Select a table to select a resource within the data connector. Click on OK when you are finished editing, or Close at any time to exit the dialog box.\n  Query parameters - when a datasource resource is chosen, for example a SharePoint list called ‘Countries’ below, then you will have an option to set conditions for filtering data.\nClick on Filter conditions to open an Edit conditions dialog box and from there click on Add a conditions group.\n    If you choose to set conditions using the steps above, then in the Edit conditions dialog box, you can set conditions based on data source parameters, operators and form fields.\n The parameter on the left comes from the data source, for example for SharePoint, there are 18 possible values listed in SharePoint parameters. See Data sources for information about other data connectors.    Within this dialog box you can also use different operators, for example Equals as shown above. See Conditions for more details on using conditions in Kianda.\n  The right-most field relates to the B2B Portal and B2B User. There are standard options listed below:\n Main Contact Name – the first name and last name of the Partner Main Contact Email – the email of the Partner Partner Company Name – the Partner organisation of the Partner Partner Current User Name – the user within the B2B Portal that is accessing the datasource Partner Current User Email – the user’s email within the B2B Portal that is accessing the datasource    When you have added conditions click on OK, or click on Close at any time to exit the dialog box.\n    When you are finished editing the security settings dialog box, click on OK, or click on Close at any time to exit the dialog box.\n  What’s next  To read more about User and group management, go to Users.\nTo read more about Dashboards, go to Dashboards.\nTo read more about Conditions, go to Conditions.\nTo read more about data source parameters, go to Connectors and from there navigate to the different predefined data connectors.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Introduction Access to the B2B Portal is controlled through standard …","ref":"/platform/portals/data-access/","tags":"","title":"Secure Data Access"},{"body":"The Submit form rule marks the current form as complete and makes it read-only.

See On Error Mapping for more details.\n  you simply need to select the field within the form which will store the error message\n  When you are finished editing the dialog box, click on OK or click on Close at any time to exit the dialog box.\n  On Success Mapping Success mapping is a concept of populating your form fields with data that is retrieved from a datasource using a data connector, to learn more about data connectors go to Data connectors. This retrieved data from the datasource is known as a response. Using this response data, you can populate a field within your form, for example you can retrieve a file which is stored in your SharePoint or Dropbox datasource and populate the retrieved file into a File field. This will give you the ability to access the retrieved file in your process.\nAll data connectors within Kianda may have different response data that can be used to populate fields in a form. You can use the Success mapping in the rules mentioned in the When to use section. Take one of the SharePoint rules Create a site as an example. When all information is filled out in the rule, in the On success mapping section you can assess the data object (response) called Site properties. From the Site properties data object you can access three different pieces of data; Site Name, Site Id and Site URL. You can map (populate) those piece of data into fields in your form by selecting a field in the Form field section:\n  Form field - this field allows you to select a field in your form to store the value from the datasource.\n  Data source field or text - this field allows you to select which piece of data your want to retrieve from the datasource, and store it in a form field.\n  Add mapping - Click on the Add mapping to add more fields for mapping results from the datasource to form fields.\n  Bin/Trash  - Click on the Bin/Trash button to delete a mapping.\n  On Error Mapping Error mapping is a concept of populating a form field in your Kianda process when using the rules from the When to use section. When using those rules, you get presented with the ability to map an error when there is an issue as the rule is executing, for example incorrectly filling out a parameter. It is useful to know the details of the error message that comes from the datasource your are connecting with. To see the error message, you need to create a separate Text box field in your form and map the error to that field. Open the On error mapping section and add a mapping by clicking on Add mapping button:\n  In the Form field, select a form field which will store the error message in your Kianda form.\n  In the Error message or text field, enter an error message that you want to appear in the event of errors or click on the text box and select the Error message option to use a system generated error indicating what has gone wrong when the rule executed.\n  Click on the Add mapping button to add further mappings.\n  Click on the Bin/Trash button to delete a mapping.\n  What’s next  To find out more about rule implementation, go to the main Rules page and then click on the links to the different rule categories.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Introduction Success and Error mapping is used to denote the success …","ref":"/platform/rules/general/mappings/","tags":"","title":"Success/Error Mapping"},{"body":"Introduction The Assign form rule is used to assign a form to a user or to a group of users, making them the form owners.

You can choose from a range of date formats where month or day leads, and time is also included, see step 5 in How to get started.\nIn the below example, the Format date rule is applied to a selected field from the drop-down list and is formatted to the MM/DD/YYYY format. The resulting formatted date is then displayed in the Formatted Date field that is selected under Select a destination field for the formatted date. You can utilise this rule to format the entered date so that it matches various national date formatting standards. The default formatting for Kianda dates are DD/MM/YYYY, so in the below example an entered date of 23/08/2022 would become 08/23/2022.\nWhen to use The format date rule should be used when you wish to amend the formatting of a date field within Kianda. For example, you receive a date from a data source in one format and wish to present it in the form in another format.\nYou can add this rule:\n to a field to a form to a process (the rule will run on load)  Before you get started In advance of using this rule, you need to have created one or more forms, complete with control fields.

The Excel template needs to be pre-created before using this rule and must be attached to a file field, this way the rule will know which template you want to use when creating the workbook.\nWhen to use Use this rule when your process requires dynamic workbook generation where the structure of those workbooks is the same for every instance, but the values of fields are different. Use this rule with combination of the Table control to output big tables and transfer them into the Excel workbook, to learn more about table control go to Table control. This rule will use an Excel template previously mapped with smart tags. Smart tags are created in Excel when a field is selected using the Kianda add-in task pane, and then inserted into the document, see image below for more details.\nYou can add this rule:\n to a field to a form to a process (the rule will run on load)  Before you get started In advance of using the Generate Excel workbook rule, in your process you need to have created at least one or more forms. The rule also requires two file fields, one for storing the Excel template and the other for storing the generated Excel workbook. To learn how to add a file go to File upload control.\n File field (Template) - used as a container to store the Excel template used to generate the workbook. File field (Generated Excel workbook) - used as a container to store the generated Excel workbook.  An Excel template that is used to generate the Excel workbook also needs to be pre-created using the Kianda add-in for Excel. You can make each generated Excel workbook very dynamic by using the smart tags that Kianda add-in uses to retrieve information for your form fields and places the values into the Excel workbook when generating it. To learn more about how to install and use Kianda add-in in Excel, go to Excel workbook add-in.\nHow to get started   Click on an existing process by going to Administration \u003e Designer and decide which form, or field you will apply the rule to, by clicking on that item so that it is in edit mode so you can see the Edit/pen button, Pen button .\n  Click on Add a rule \u003e File management \u003e Generate excel workbook.\n  In the Edit rule - Generate excel workbook dialog box, give the rule a title in the Title field.\n  If you want to add conditions for the rule, click on the Edit conditions button , see Conditions for more details.\n  Under the Action section fill out the following:\n  Excel workbook template - select a file field that stores the Excel template.

By default, Kianda applies a site-wide style that gives your workspace a consistent look and feel. However, as a workspace Administrator, you can override these defaults by using the Global CSS file. This lets you adjust aesthetics, tweak layouts, and even enhance functionality for your forms, processes, and dashboards.\nWhy Use the Global CSS File? Global CSS lets you implement style changes that appear throughout your entire Kianda workspace. Rather than adjusting individual elements in each process or dashboard, you can create a unified look or add distinctive branding across all pages at once.\nFor example, you can:\n Apply consistent branding: Match your company’s color palette, typography, and visual identity. Improve usability: Make key buttons larger, adjust spacing for better readability, or change how messages are highlighted. Add functional styling: Hide certain elements until triggered by JavaScript, or highlight form fields based on conditions.  Before You Begin Plan your design. Decide in advance what changes you want to make, and consider creating mock-ups to visualize the final look. Having a clear design direction helps ensure your CSS changes are cohesive and meaningful.\nIf you’re new to CSS or Bootstrap, you might review basic CSS and Bootstrap documentation first. Since Kianda is built on Bootstrap, you can use familiar classes, breakpoints, and responsive utilities to craft a user-friendly layout.\nWhere to Find and Edit the Global CSS File   As an Administrator, go to Administration \u003e Developer.\n  Click on Edit Global CSS.\n  The global CSS file editor opens allowing a developer to edit the global CSS file.\n  When finished, click OK, then Save Changes in the Look and Feel section. Refresh Kianda to ensure the changes load.\n  Effective Use of CSS Classes CSS classes let you define a style rule once and apply it to multiple elements. For instance, to create a “tile” style that you can reuse across many forms:\n.tile {  border-radius: 12px;  border: 1px solid #e7eaee;  background: white;  margin-bottom: 15px;  padding: 18px 15px 2px 15px; } Next, apply this class to any element in Kianda by typing “tile” into the Custom CSS class name field in the process designer.\nTip: Use clear, descriptive class names. They help you maintain consistency and make future adjustments easier.\nBeyond Look and Feel: Using CSS for Functionality While CSS is primarily for styling, you can also pair it with JavaScript to achieve functional effects. For example, you could:\n Hide elements: Use display:none; in CSS to initially hide a button, then show it dynamically through JavaScript. Highlight states: Combine CSS classes with conditions in Kianda’s logic to emphasize fields that need attention.  This blend of styling and scripting can improve your workflows without cluttering your markup.\nWorking with Bootstrap Since Kianda uses Bootstrap, you can leverage Bootstrap’s utility classes to quickly style elements without custom CSS. For example, use .text-center to center text or .d-none to hide elements. If you do need custom rules, try extending or overriding Bootstrap styles sparingly. Keep these tips in mind:\n Avoid deep overrides: Stick to high-level classes or create new classes rather than overriding too many built-in Bootstrap rules. This reduces complexity. Responsive design: Use Bootstrap’s responsive classes and media queries to ensure your workspace looks good on all devices.  Using Font Awesome Icons Icons can improve usability and help users instantly recognize actions:\na:before {  font-family: \"Font Awesome 5 Free\";  content: \"\\f007\";  display: inline-block;  padding-right: 10px;  vertical-align: middle;  font-weight: 900; } This rule displays a user icon before any link (\u003ca\u003e element). Adjust icons by changing the Unicode value or adding conditions. For more details, see Font Awesome’s pseudo-elements guide and cheatsheet.\nLocal vs. Global CSS While the Global CSS file affects your entire Kianda workspace, sometimes you want to make changes only in one process or dashboard. In that case, add \u003cstyle\u003e tags directly into a Rich Text field in that process or dashboard. This local approach ensures your changes are contained and won’t impact other parts of the system.\nFor example, to color all buttons magenta in a specific process:\n Add a Rich Text field to your process. Open Code View and wrap your CSS in \u003cstyle\u003e\u003c/style\u003e tags. Add your button styling inside the tags. Save and preview the process—the buttons will now have a magenta background, without altering buttons in other processes.  Naming Conventions and Maintenance Over time, your Global CSS file can grow. Keep it maintainable by:\n Using meaningful names: Class names like .primary-btn or .invoice-tile convey purpose. Grouping related styles: Organize your file so that similar rules (e.g., buttons, panels, modals) are together. Commenting your code: Document why certain overrides exist. This helps future administrators or developers understand your intentions.  Testing and Iteration After saving changes, always refresh Kianda and test your workspace on different devices or browsers. Check that your modifications didn’t unintentionally affect other elements. If you notice unwanted changes, refine your selectors or consider using local CSS for more targeted modifications.\n In summary, the Global CSS file is a powerful tool that helps you shape your Kianda environment. By planning ahead, using descriptive classes, taking advantage of Bootstrap utilities, and keeping your code organized, you’ll create a more engaging, visually appealing, and functional workspace for your users.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Kianda’s visual style is built on standard web technologies—primarily …","ref":"/low-code/global-css/","tags":"","title":"Global CSS file"},{"body":"This video demonstrates how to create a simple modal dialog.\nYour browser does not support the video tag.

Using this rule automates and speeds up the process of populating a table when a lot of data is present. CSV files may look different depending on what program you will open it with, here is an example of a CSV file opened with Excel:\nHere is the same file opened using Notepad:\nAs shown in the two images above, the format changes depending on what program you open the file with. Using the Notepad, each column is separated with a comma and each new line is a row. Excel formats commas and new lines automatically and creates numbers for rows and letters for columns. The CSV file can be separated using different separators other than comma. For example you can use ; as a separator, keep in mind that Excel does not format non-comma separated values correctly and the file will look as follows when opened using Excel:\nHere is the same file opened using Notepad:\nWhen to use You can use this rule to populate a table when there is a lot of data present in a CSV file. Apply this rule to a process so that your table is populated automatically when a process has been loaded.\nYou can add this rule:\n to a field to a form to a process (the rule will run on load)  Before you get started For this rule to work there are a couple of prerequisites needed inside of your process:\n Table - needed to let the rule know which table will be populated using the csv file, for more detail on how to add a table go to Table control. File - needed as a container to hold your csv file. Using a file control, you can upload a csv file and use that csv file to populate a table. For more detail on how to add a file go to File upload control.  Keep in mind that in order to populate a table within your process correctly, you need to have the same amount of columns in the table as inside of the CSV file. For example a table looking as follows:\nThis indicates that the CSV file that we want to import should have three columns:\nHow to get started   Click on an existing process by going to Administration \u003e Designer and decide which form, or field you will apply the rule to, by clicking on that item so that it is in edit mode so you can see the Edit/pen button, Pen button .\n  Click on Add a rule \u003e Table \u003e Import CSV.\n  In the Edit rule - Import CSV dialog box, give the rule a title in the Title field.\n  If you want to add conditions for the rule, click on the Edit conditions button see Conditions for more details.\n  Under the Action section fill out the following:\n  Select the CSV file field - select a file field containing a csv file. This file field needs to be pre-created as it is a required field when using this rule. the csv file attached to this field will be used to populate the table.\n  CSV separator - the default separator is a comma ( , ) but you can set it to any character, number or symbol you want. Keep in mind that the separator fields separates each column of a row. For example you can have a file that looks as follows:\nThis image represents how a table looks like applying the Import CSV rule with a sample file and when the CSV separator is set to a comma ( , ) see below:\n  Num cols. in CSV - this field represents the number of columns in your CSV file. From the example and image above, this field is set to three.\n  Skip first line - radio button asking whether to skip the first line or add the first line of the CSV file. If the first line of your CSV file represents the title of the column, you can select Yes and the line will not be included in your table.\n  Destination table - field that allows you to select the table you want to target when populating data from the CSV file. New mapping options are presented when selecting a table.\n  Table row field - select the row you want to target when setting a value.\n  CSV field or text - you can select a field/column within your CSV file or type in text manually to represent the value you want your field to contain.\n  Add mapping - you can choose to assign values to multiple fields in your row by clicking on Add mapping button. You can also remove fields by clicking on the Bin/Trash icon .\nGoing back to the CSV separator example image, to achieve the correct mapping, we need to add three fields as shown below:\n    Existing rows behavior - you have two options when populating data into your selected table:\n Override - will override all existing rows of your table with the new data from your CSV file. Append - will ignore the existing rows inside of your table and simply append all the new rows from your CSV file to the end of the table.    CSV Date format - type in manually the data format that you have set in your CSV file. This applies to a column when it is of type Date. The formatting of the date specified in tis field must be the same as in your CSV file. For example when your date format in the CSV file is DD/MM/YYYY and CSV Date format option is set to YYYY/DD/MM, you can encounter date bugs in your table.\n    When you are finished editing the dialog box, click on OK or click on Close at any time to exit the dialog box.\n  Editing, deleting or duplicating rules When you have clicked on an existing rule, and the rule is visible in the right-hand pane under Rules, there are a number of options available to you.\n To disable a rule click the slider across beside the rule name.

Because Kianda is built on open web technologies—primarily CSS, JavaScript, and micro-services—you can put your existing skills to work right away. Instead of grappling with proprietary systems, you’ll find familiar tools and frameworks, making it straightforward to build and customize applications to meet your organization’s needs.\nKey Technologies Under the Hood Kianda’s front-end leverages established, open-source tools including Ember.js, Bootstrap, and features like web sockets and AJAX for real-time, responsive interfaces. This front-end stack lets you quickly create modern, dynamic user experiences using the same skills you apply every day in web development.\nOn the back-end, Kianda’s architecture is powered by scalable micro-services running on top of widely used technologies like .NET and Node.js, ensuring that your applications are both reliable and easy to maintain. By embracing these open standards, Kianda allows you to integrate seamlessly with other systems and tools in your ecosystem.\nEmber.js and Handlebars Kianda’s user interface is built using Ember.js, an open-source JavaScript framework well-known for its convention-over-configuration approach. This means you can write less boilerplate code while still delivering high-quality, maintainable applications. Ember.js works hand-in-hand with the Handlebars templating library. Handlebars makes it simple to bind data to templates, dynamically generate HTML, and reuse common UI patterns.\nIf you’re already comfortable with JavaScript and modern CSS frameworks, you’ll find working with Ember.js and Handlebars an easy step forward. For more on best practices, see our Ember Inspector guide and explore Ember.js documentation and Handlebars documentation.\nWhy Choose Low-Code with Kianda? Low-code development reduces the time and effort needed to build enterprise applications. By using Kianda’s graphical interface and predefined building blocks, you can rapidly assemble process apps that integrate with your company’s workflows. At the same time, Kianda’s openness means you’re never locked in. If a standard component isn’t a perfect fit, you can dive into the code and craft a solution that suits your exact requirements.\nKianda provides a large selection of ready-to-use fields and rules, so non-developers can create forms and workflows without writing code. But when you need something more advanced, Kianda’s low-code approach lets you implement custom logic and UI widgets using the CSS and JavaScript skills you already have.\nFor example, you might create a new field type that displays images in a custom layout or build a bespoke rule widget for integrating with an external data source. You can also fine-tune list widgets for dashboards or write JavaScript expressions to automate tasks like generating unique IDs or formatting text.\nWhat You Can Do as a Developer With an administrator role, you have access to Administration functions that let you tailor the platform:\n Modify the Global JavaScript and Global CSS files to set application-wide styles or logic. Create custom Field, Rule, Dashboard, or data connector widgets to extend the platform’s capabilities. Integrate external data sources and use your own JavaScript expressions in fields, rules, or anywhere rich text is used, like in emails and dashboards. Customize list widgets to display data in dashboards in a way that makes sense for your organization’s metrics and KPIs. Incorporate HTML and custom styling in forms and emails to produce richer user experiences.  These options give you the flexibility to shape Kianda to fit your exact business processes, without leaving the familiar territory of open web development.\nKianda Developer: Your Interface for Custom Widgets Kianda Developer is a user-friendly interface that lets you build and manage reusable widgets. Instead of starting from scratch, you can focus on your core logic or design. You can create:\n Field widgets: Custom UI elements that appear on-screen, such as specialized inputs or interactive controls. Rule widgets: Automated logic components that manipulate data, set statuses, or initiate actions. Dashboard widgets: Dynamic visualizations or layouts for presenting information on dashboard pages. Data connector widgets: Integrations for sending and receiving data from external sources.  Getting Started with Kianda Developer  Open Administration \u003e Developer to see all custom widgets in your environment. Browse existing widgets, review version histories, edit or delete widgets, and easily restore previous versions. To create a new widget, click New widget, provide a title, pick an icon, and choose a widget type. Then add your HTML, Handlebars, and JavaScript logic. Once you’re done, you can export your custom widget as part of a Kianda file and import it into another environment. This portability ensures you can reuse and share your work seamlessly.  Example of a Field Widget Below is an example of a simple field widget’s Handlebar and JavaScript code. The Handlebar template adapts based on the widget’s display mode (design, edit, settings, display), and the JavaScript object defines functions for each mode.\nHandlebars UI:\n{{#if (eq displayMode \"design\")}}{{input required=field.required maxlength=\"4\" type=\"text\" value=field.text class=\"form-control\"}}{{/if}}{{#if (eq displayMode \"edit\")}}{{input required=field.required maxlength=\"4\" type=\"text\" value=field.text class=\"form-control\"}}{{/if}}{{#if (eq displayMode \"settings\")}}\u003c!-- Add UI for settings here if needed --\u003e {{/if}}{{#if (eq displayMode \"display\")}}\u003cp class=\"text-muted\"\u003e{{field.text}}\u003c/p\u003e {{/if}}JavaScript Logic:\n{  edit: function() {  // Code for edit mode  },  display: function() {  // Code for display mode  },  settings: function() {  // Code for settings mode  } } This structure allows you to cleanly separate your UI and logic, making development and maintenance straightforward.\nJavaScript Expressions Everywhere Kianda supports using JavaScript expressions throughout its platform—inside fields, rules, and email templates. For instance, you can combine multiple field values to generate new strings, format data dynamically, or even create direct links to specific process instances with functions like ProcessLink().\nTo learn more, visit our Expression builder guide and explore how to inject logic and dynamic content anywhere you need it.\n By building on open technologies like CSS, JavaScript, Ember.js, and Handlebars, Kianda lets you apply the full range of your web development experience. Whether you’re creating simple apps or highly customized widgets, Kianda’s low-code approach helps you deliver results faster—without sacrificing flexibility or control.\n","categories":"","description":"Low-code development guides.

Number fields can be formatted to be integers (whole numbers), currency or percentages.\nFor example, in a Purchase Order Request form, you may want to use Number fields to allow the user to insert the number, unit price and total cost of items being ordered and you may apply rules to some of those fields so that they perform calculations or pull values from other fields or forms. Go to Rules and Expression builder for more information on how you make your forms dynamic.\nHow to get started   To add a Number field to a form, first open the relevant process.\n  Then select the form within that process that you want to add the field to (so that the Edit Form button is visible).\n  Click on Controls in the left-hand pane to expand the Controls menu.\n  Select Input to view the range of Input controls and click on Number.\nA number field will be added to your form with the default title of ‘’Number 1’’ and a pop-up message will say ‘Field added’.\nBy default, the new Number field will have up and down arrow buttons at the right that users can click to increase or decrease the number in the field and will show any numbers entered to two decimal places. These settings can be amended by editing the field.\nIn the example shown here, a new Number field has been added to form called ‘Training Request’. This new Number field could be edited to rename it ‘Cost of Training Course’ and could be formatted as currency (Euro) so that users could insert the cost of the training course they want to take.\n  How to edit, move and delete Number fields To edit a Number field:\n  Select the field (by either clicking on the field title or on the field’s Drag handle button ).\n  Click on the Edit field button (Pen icon) .\nThe Edit field - Number dialog box will open, enabling you to choose from a range of options:\n  Title - you can change the title of the Number field from the default ‘Number 1’.\n  Name - This is a unique name for the field and inherits a camel case version of the entered Title.\n  Help text - you can insert text to help the form user to complete the Number field. If you add help text, a question mark icon will appear next to the field title and, if the user clicks on this, they will see the help text you have inserted.\n  Custom CSS class name - You can type the name of a CSS class to allow the Number to inherit specific styles defined in the Global CSS file.\n  Display format - you can choose whether the number inserted by the user is formatted to be an integer (whole number), currency or a percentage.\nIf you select Currency as the Display format, a new option will appear - Currency format - where you can select the currency you want to use.\nIf you select Euro as the Currency format, a new format option called Country format appears to the right. This is a drop-down list from which you can choose from three different ways that Euro amounts can be displayed:\nIf you choose Ireland as the Country format, Euro amounts will be displayed like this:\nIf you choose Portugal as the Country format, Euro amounts will be displayed like this:\nIf you choose France as the Country format, Euro amounts will be displayed like this:\n  Show number up/down arrows - you can choose whether or not you want the Number field to have up/down arrow buttons that enable the user to increase or decrease the number in the field.\n  Enable native number input on mobile - you can select this to enable native number input when a user is completing the Number field on their mobile phone.\n  Decimal places - you can insert the number of decimal places you want the figure in the Number field to have.\n  Placeholder - you can insert placeholder text to appear in the Number field to assist the user. For example, this Number field titled ‘Salary’ has placeholder text:\n  Expression - you can add an expression to your Number field if, for example, you want the field to contain a calculation based on another field or want it to pull values from other fields. To add an expression, click on the expression button (ellipsis) to open the Expression builder dialog box - here you can add expressions to perform math operations and various other actions.\nFor example, let’s say you have a Number field called ‘Salary’ where the user inputs their salary and another Number field called ‘Bonus’ which you want to be automatically populated with a figure that is 20% of the ‘Salary’ figure. To do this, you add an Expression to the ‘Bonus’ field:\nNow when a user completes the ‘Salary’ field, the Bonus field automatically populates with a figure that is 20% of their salary:\nTo learn more about applying rules and expressions to Number fields, go to Rules and Expression builder.\n  Make whatever changes you want in this Edit field - Number dialog box and then click OK to confirm.\n  To move a Number field:\n Select the field’s Drag handle button . Drag and drop the field wherever you want to move it to within your form.  To delete a Number field from your form:\n Select the field (by either clicking on the field’s name or its drag handle button ). Click on the Bin/Trash button . Click on OK to confirm.  How to edit Number field properties To view or edit the field properties associated with a Number field, select the field (by clicking on the field title or field drag handle button ) - the Field properties menu will appear in the right-hand pane.\nFor example, the Field Properties associated with a Number field titled ‘Salary’ are shown here and include:\n Field type - The type of field, in this case a Number field. Title - The Title of the field, in this case ‘Salary’. Show title - If this is selected, the Number field title will be shown in the form. Required - If this is selected, the Number field will be mandatory for the form user. Enabled - If this is selected, the user will be able to edit or interact with the field. Visible - If this is selected, the Number field will be visible in the form. Layout - The width of the blue bar can be adjusted to change the width of the Number field as it appears on a PC or mobile phone (to view the Mobile layout, click on the expand button to the right).  To learn more about the different options within the Field properties menu, go to Field Properties.\nSaving changes and version history Make sure to save any changes you make by clicking on the Save button . You will always have the option to revert back to previous versions of your form by clicking the Design Version History button in the top right corner.\nWhat’s next  Now that you’ve learned about the Number control, find out more about the other types of Input fields you can add to a Kianda process:\n Date control File upload control List control Table control Text box control Toggle control User picker control  ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Number controls (fields) can be inserted in a form if you want form …","ref":"/platform/controls/input/number/","tags":"","title":"Number control"},{"body":"Business rules are what makes Kianda forms come alive. They represent the actual actions users intend to perform when they interact with form components. There are 60 rules you can apply to forms, see Rules list.\nThere are two key principles to consider when working with forms:\n  Rule design - you can decide what type of rule you are going to apply and where, as a rule can be applied at field/control level, form level and process level. For the latter the rule will execute ‘onload’ that is when the process instance is initiated.\n  Rule order - if there are several rules attached to an item like a button, then the order of execution is important and can be modified to suit your needs.\n  These principles are explained in more in the next section on How to get started.\nHow to get started If you have the role Administrator or Design business process, go to Administration \u003e Designer and click on a process or create a new process, the predefined rules are found in the left-hand pane under Add a rule.\nThere are 10 categories of rules:\n Workflow - rules that represent the actions a user intends to perform when they interact with form components. These rules enable you to execute actions that can change the flow of information within a process. There are 7 workflow rules, see Workflow for more information. Communications - rules associated with user communication for example sending an email, meeting request or triggering a user alert. There are 4 communication rules, see Communications for more information. Data - rules associated with database operations such as Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) allowing these actions to occur on configured data sources. There are 5 data rules, see Data for more information. Users - rules associated with user properties, allowing user lookup based on a user attribute or retrieve a user property. There are 4 user rules, see Users for more information. File management - rules concerned with generating documents such as Word, Excel or converting to PDF. There are 7 file management rules, see File Management for more information. Tables - rules associated with table operations such as sorting, copying table rows to another table, adding and removing table rows. There are 12 table rules, see Tables for more information. Dates - date rules to calculate time and format dates with advanced filter options like omitting weekends or special dates. There are 4 date rules, see Dates for more information. Form actions - rules linked to actions that are part of forms, for example submit, close or save. There are 6 form rules, see Form actions for more information. SharePoint - SharePoint associated rules such as adding, finding or removing users, defining permissions and check-in/checkout of an item. There are 10 SharePoint rules, see SharePoint for more information. Kianda AI - there is 1 Kianda AI rule related to text analysis, see Kianda AI for more information.  Rule design You can apply rules at button, field, and form level. At form level, rule(s) execute ‘on load’, that is when a process instance is initiated or kicked off for example as a result of a user creating a new instance from a dashboard, or automated through a scheduled task, then the rules are triggered into action when the form(s) within that process becomes the active form(s).\nTo get started with rule design:\n  Click on an existing process or create a new process by going to Administration in the left-hand side menu and then click on Designer.\n  For existing processes and forms, decide which process, form or field you will apply the rule to by clicking on that item so that it is in edit mode so you can see the Pen button, Pen button for example a form Training Approval or Submit button. For new processes, add in forms and fields and select an element to add a rule to.\n  Click on Add a rule in the left-hand pane and click on a category of choice, such as Communications and then a rule, for example User alert.\n  When you have chosen your rule, an Edit rule dialog box opens allowing you to configure the rule to execute a particular action, which can be according to conditions if you wish.\n  The links at the end of this page will bring you to the different rule categories and from there you can navigate to rule pages to learn what each parameter is in the Edit rule dialog box for each rule. The next section highlights where rules can be applied.\nWhere to apply rules As introduced in the section above, rules can be added at process, form and control/field level, and are typically used as follows, bearing in mind that Conditions can be applied to rules to control how the rules are executed:\n  A rule applied at process level executes ‘onload’ meaning that when a new process instance is initiated, the rule will automatically execute, for example when someone opens a form, a ‘Send email’ rule could be used to send an email to someone notifying them that a form has been opened.\n  A rule applied at form level executes when the form is submitted.\n  A rule applied at control level executes when the chosen field is clicked on, or involved in user or system interaction.\nAs with all rules, Conditions within the rule determine how the rule is triggered, for example a rule applied to a control like a date field, may be executed only if a certain value is input into another field within a form.\n  Edit rule dialog box Whenever a rule is added, the Edit rule dialog box will remind you where and at what level the rule is being applied, for example in the image below a Send email rule is being added to a button/control called Submit.\nNote: Make sure that you save the process after adding forms and/or controls and before adding rules so that the names of the processes, forms or controls are committed to the Kianda database. Then the dialog box above can then retrieve the name(s) for use as shown above.\nRule order If there is more than one rule for an item like a field or process, then the order of execution must be considered.\nFor example for a Submit button on a form, you may want a Send email rule to be executed first before any other rule is executed, that is an automated email will be sent before anything else. To ensure this happens, click on the Submit button to make sure you are in Edit mode, and under Rules in the right-hand pane, drag the Send email rule to the top of the list by clicking on the rule and dragging it to the top of the list of rules.\nGo to Multiple rules to read more about using multiple rules on a field or other item.\nRules list A full list of rules is available in the table below.\nWhat’s next  We have briefly introduced the concept of Rules.

Single sign-on allows the user to log in one time and access services without re-entering authentication factors.\nOn Kianda, Single-Sign-On allows the user to login via Single Sign-On connector. This connector for example could be SharePoint, Office365 or Salesforce.\nHow to get started To enable Single-Sign-On, follow the steps below:\n  Login to Kianda with an Administrator account.\n  From the left-hand side pane, click on Administration \u003e Subscription \u003e Details.\n  In the Single Sign-On Details page, beside Enable Single Sign-On click on Yes to enable Single Sign-On.

It works by passing authentication data between an identity provider (IdP) and a service provider such as Kianda.\n  If you choose Office 365, you must choose an Office 365 Connector from a dropdown list. This will show Office 365 datasources already created in the Data sources function under Administration. Go to Office 365 data connector to learn how to create a data source if one doesn’t exist.\n​   If you choose SAML 2.0, you must provide the SAML 2.0 Target URL. This is the identify provider (Idp ) URL. You can also provide the SAML 2.0 Token Signing Certificate (.cer) by clicking on Browse to navigate, find and add the cert, a .cer file to the details page.\n    For Auto redirect to SSO choose from No or Yes. If you choose Yes then users cannot login with their Kianda username and password directly, and are automatically redirected to the configured SSO provider for authentication.\n However if you have an external set of users, for example contractor who need access to Kianda, you can set a SSO bypass group. You must define a group of users in advance, using the group creation option within the Users function under Administration. From here you can define a group of users that can login using Kianda’s username and password. Use this option for users that are external for the configured SSO provider, so they can go directly to the workspace login page to login.    For the option Default “Remember Me” to false choose from No or Yes, to remember the login credentials.\n  When you have completed your edits, click on Save Changes or click on the Back button at any time to exit the page without saving.\n  SAML assertion attributes For successful authentication the following attributes must be passed to Kianda. Kianda will primarly validate the NameID and the UPN in second place while authentication a SAML 2.0 response.\n NameID The existance of the NameID property with emailAddress format is required.

The rule will read one or more items of data from a chosen data source, for example SharePoint, SAP or Oracle databases, see Data connectors for more details.\nThe Data source filter in this rule is used for targeting specific data item in your data connection. The item you want to update within your data source is targeted by filtering it out using a field within your form. It is a good idea to connect a dummy field to your data source first and then use that field to filter for the item you want to update. The actual value used to update the item in your data source can also use a field or text filled out in your mapping section (see below for more detail). To make your Update item rule extremely dynamic, it is recommended to create field for filtering an item and a separate field for the new value you want your item to hold.\nWhen to use The Update item rule should be used whenever you want to update an existing item within a data source of your choice.\nYou can add this rule:\n to a field to a form to a process (the rule will run on load)  How to get started   Click on an existing process by going to Administration \u003e Designer and decide which form, or field you will apply the rule to, by clicking on that item so that it is in edit mode so you can see the Edit/pen button .\n  Click on Add a rule \u003e Data \u003e Update item.\n  In the Edit rule - Update item dialog box, give the rule a title in the Title field.\n  If you want to add conditions for the rule, click on the Edit conditions button , see Conditions for more details.\n  Click on Select data source button to select the data source you want to update an item in.

The condition uses a field from within your form and therefore it is good practice to create a field and connect it to your data source to have the ability of selecting an item that you want to update. To learn more about conditions go to Conditions.\n  Input mapping - used to update an item inside of the datasource that you selected. Within this section the following fields are visible:\n Form field or text - you can select a field within your form or type in text manually to represent the value you want your updated item to contain. Data source field - select a field in your data source to hold the new value. Add mapping - you can choose to create multiple items in your data source by clicking on Add mapping button. You can also remove fields by clicking on the Bin/Trash icon .    On success mapping - select the field(s) in the form which will store information and populate the data source field or text field with the respective data source value. To learn more about success mapping go to On Success Mapping.\n  On error mapping - select the field(s) in the form which will store error messages. Then type in a value or use Error message, to create a system generated error message if an error occurs during rule execution. To learn more about error mapping go to On Error Mapping.\n  Ignore mapping for blank fields - used to check if there are any blank field that need to be updated on the datasource. For example, if there are two fields to be updated and the user wants to update only one, and leaves the other blank, then the filled out field is updated and the other field is left unchanged.\n  Editing, deleting or duplicating rules When you have clicked on an existing rule, and the rule is visible in the right-hand pane under Rules, there are a number of options available to you.\n To disable a rule click the slider across beside the rule name.

The user rules also allow you to invite partners and share a particular process with them. These rules are very useful when you want to do any property actions on a user like find a user or update a property of a specific user.\nTake an example of a Look up user by property rule. Implementing this rule will allow you to store a user in a User picker field by providing a property of a user, for example user role or email address. See image below when a location is being chosen, a trainer is found that is assigned to the location:\nIn this example the Location of training is a List control is connected to a SQL Server connector. The Display field, Value field and Sort by of the List control is set to Location. With the list control set up that way, we are provided with a list based on our Location column in the database. For more information on how to create a List control and set its datasource go to List control. See image below to see how the Location of training field is set up:\nWith all of our users, we have set up a Location property and each user is assigned a different locations based on where they operate and provide training. The lookup user by property is set to Location which we provide to the rule by selecting our Location of training field.

In a pie chart, the arc length of each slice is proportional to the quantity it represents. To learn how to create a pie chart using Chart v2, visit How to create a Pie Chart. Bar chart - A bar chart or bar graph is a chart or graph that presents categorical data with rectangular bars with heights or lengths proportional to the values that they represent. The bars can be plotted vertically or horizontally. A vertical bar chart is sometimes called a column chart. To learn how to create a pie chart using Chart v2, visit How to create a Bar Chart. Line chart - A line chart or line graph or curve chart is a type of chart which displays information as a series of data points called ‘markers’ connected by straight line segments. It is a basic type of chart common in many fields. To learn how to create a pie chart using Chart v2, visit How to create a Line Chart. Radar chart - Radar Charts are used to compare two or more items or groups on various features or characteristics. Example: Compare two anti-depressant drugs on features such as: efficacy for severe depression, prevalence of specific side effects, interaction with alcohol, continuation of relief over time, cost to the consumer etc. To learn how to create a pie chart using Chart v2, visit How to create a Radar Chart. Doughnut chart - Donut charts are used to show the proportions of categorical data, with the size of each piece representing the proportion of each category. A donut chart is created using a string field and a count of features, number, or rate/ratio field. To learn how to create a pie chart using Chart v2, visit How to create a Doughnut Chart. Polar area chart - Polar area charts are similar to pie charts, but each segment has the same angle - the radius of the segment differs depending on the value. This type of chart is often useful when we want to show a comparison data similar to a pie chart, but also show a scale of values for context.

It is used for sending email messages from one email account to another via the internet. The SMTP server checks whether the two emails are valid and proceeds with sending of the email. To be able sending of email using your email provider, the following details need to be filled out:\n SMTP server - SMTP server is an address for a given mailing service, it usually comes in the form of smtp.yourdomain.com. For example Google’s SMTP is smtp.gmail.com. To access your IMAP address, contact your email provider or email server. SMTP server port - Indicates which port your SMTP server listens to. The SMTP servers typically listen to port 25 if unencrypted or 465 with SSL encryption. The port information can be found by contacting your email provider. Email address - Used to send test email to ensure emails are delivered. Use same credentials as above - By choosing Yes, you will be using the same credentials to log into your SMTP server as you are to the IMAP server. If your SMTP server credentials are different, select No to be presented with:  SMTP Username - The credentials used to access your SMTP provider. Password - The credentials used to access your SMTP provider.    Setting up a Global SMTP mail connector As mentioned above, you can create multiple Email connectors and use them to send emails using different email accounts such as support@ or info@. You can also choose to ignore all email connectors as well as the no-reply@kianda.com emails by enabling one Global SMTP connector which forces all sent email to come from one single connector. To set a Global SMTP connector, you need Administrator rights in your Kianda platform.\n Note: to set up a global SMTP mail connector, you need to have an Email connector set up, see the steps under How to get started on how to set up an email connector.\n   From the Kianda home page, click on Administration \u003e Subscription \u003e Subscription Details.\n  Under General settings, select Yes on the Enable Global SMTP Main Connector option.\n  A SMTP Email connector dropdown box appears. Select your desired email connector.\n  In the Enable save to “Sent Items” option select Yes if you want your email to save all emails sent and select No to not save. If you select Yes, the emails will be saved in the Sent Items folder in your email.\n  ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"In your company’s Kianda platform you can connect an emailing service …","ref":"/platform/connectors/email/","tags":"","title":"Email connector"},{"body":"Introduction The Export CSV rule allows you export a specified table from within your process into a CSV (Comma Separated Values) file. In the edit rule dialog box you can format how each value is separated and which columns to include and exclude when exporting. Keep in mind when exporting a table into a CSV format, it will export data for the following field types:\n Text box Number Date  Any other field types will be ignored, for example all control types from within Layout and Actions will be ignored.\nWhen to use You can use this rule when you want to open the table with a notepad or excel. This rule is also useful when you want to share a table with other users, you can do that by exporting the table into a File field and attaching the file into an email using the Send email rule. To learn more about attaching a file into an email go to Attachments.\nYou can add this rule:\n to a field to a form to a process (the rule will run on load)  Before you get started For this rule to work there are a couple of prerequisites needed inside of your process:\n Table - needed to let the rule know which table will be used to export into the CSV file, for more detail on how to add a table go to Table control. File - needed as a container to hold your exported CSV file. When the table is exported into this file field, you can downloaded by clicking on the file name. For more detail on how to add a file field go to File upload control.  How to get started   Click on an existing process by going to Administration \u003e Designer and decide which form, or field you will apply the rule to, by clicking on that item so that it is in edit mode so you can see the Edit/pen button, Pen button .\n  Click on Add a rule \u003e Table \u003e Export CSV.\n  In the Edit rule - Export CSV dialog box, give the rule a title in the Title field.\n  If you want to add conditions for the rule, click on the Edit conditions button see Conditions for more details. It is a good idea to add condition to this rule to prevent exporting incomplete tables.\n  Under the Action section fill out the following:\n  Origin table - field that allows you to select the table you want to target when exporting into a CSV file. When selecting a table, new options appear:\n  Columns to export - this is a checklist allowing you to select or deselect columns from a table that you want to keep or dismiss from exporting into the CSV file. These fields will correspond to field names given in your table, see below image for an example.\nTable with three columns will correspond to Columns to export option in the export CSV edit rule dialog box.\n  CSV separator - the default separator is a comma  , but you can set it to any character, number or symbol you want. Keep in mind that the separator fields separates each column of a row. For example you can have a file that looks as follows when setting this field with a semi-colon ;as shown with Notepad below:\nKeep in mind when exporting a table using a separator other than a comma , and open it in Excel, the data will not be formatted correctly within Excel as it recognises columns when only separated by commas , for example the above file is opened with Notepad while the image below shows the same exported file opened with Excel:\n  Include header row - radio button asking whether to include the header row meaning that the column title will be included or not.\n  Destination file field - field specifying the container which hold the csv file of the exported table. When the CSV file is present in the file field, the name of the file will be the same as the title of the table specified to export. For example if the title of a table is Countries, the file will be called Countrie.csv. You can download the file by clicking on the file name.\n    When you are finished editing the dialog box, click on OK or click on Close at any time to exit the dialog box.\n  Editing, deleting or duplicating rules When you have clicked on an existing rule, and the rule is visible in the right-hand pane under Rules, there are a number of options available to you.\n To disable a rule click the slider across beside the rule name. To copy a rule, click on the Duplicate button beside the rule name. To delete a rule, click on the Bin/Trash button . To view a rule, click on the rule name to open the Edit rule dialog box.

These operations are useful when creating Word/Excel where the structure of those documents is the same for every instance but values are different. You can also use the File management rules for creating anonymous links which give access to files without permissions.\nTake an example of a Create a file anonymous link rule. Implementing this rule will result in a randomly generated link which will lead to a file that you want to share. This link can be opened in any browser and can be accessible by anyone and there is no need for authentication when opening the link. You can also set the expiry time of the created link which will cause the link not to exist after the specified time. See images below for an example of the Create a file anonymous link rule:\nGetting started with File management rules If you go to Administration \u003e Designer and click on a process or create a new process, then click on Add a rule the File management rules are found in the left-hand pane when you click on File management.\nThere are seven types of File management rules as follows:\n  Copy file - allows copying files between datasources. Use this file together with two file fields to move files between two different file locations. For example to copy files between an on premises folder and a SharePoint folder.\n  Convert to PDF - this rule allows the conversation of DOCX and DOC files into PDF format.\n  Generate word document - this rule generates a Word document from data associated with a process instance using a user-designed template.\n  Generate excel document - this rule generates an Excel workbook from data associated with a process instance using a user-designed template.\n  Set existing file - this rule is used to make an existing file accessible by a link, available within a configured file field. For example when you have access to a file through a link, you can use this link to store the file in a file field within your process.\n  Merge PDF - this rule allows you to merge two or more PDF files into a single PDF file. It also allows you to merge image file such as PNG or JPG to an existing PDF file.\n  Create a file anonymous link - this rule generates file links that can be shared anonymously with external users. No authentication is required when opening the anonymous link to a file.\n  What’s next  To read more about each of the rule types go to the links below:\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"File management rules is one category of rules to enable operations …","ref":"/platform/rules/files/","tags":"","title":"File management rules"},{"body":"The Global JavaScript file in Kianda gives you a central place to add custom JavaScript code that will be loaded and available across your entire workspace. Whether you want to create helper functions, bind custom actions to user interactions, or integrate with front-end frameworks at a deeper level, this file provides a convenient, site-wide JavaScript environment.\nBecause it’s globally accessible, you can think of this file as your own mini library of utilities and features that any process, form, or dashboard in Kianda can tap into. For example, you could define functions to:\n Manipulate DOM elements dynamically, Handle global events or user interactions, Integrate external APIs or services consistently, Hook into the Ember.js application lifecycle that Kianda’s front-end runs on.  Why Use a Global JavaScript File? Reuse and maintainability: Instead of duplicating code across multiple processes or forms, write it once here. Any code in this file can be called from anywhere else, reducing repetition and simplifying long-term maintenance.\nCentralized customization: Keep your custom logic organized in one place. If you need to adjust a commonly used function, updating it in the Global JavaScript file instantly applies the change throughout the workspace.\nDeep integration: Kianda is built on Ember.js. By hooking into the Ember application through the global file, you can access app instances, sessions, and stores, letting you implement advanced custom behaviors that integrate with Kianda’s internal mechanisms.\nGetting Started   Access the Developer Page:\nAs an Administrator, go to Administration \u003e Developer in the Kianda menu.\n  Open Global JavaScript Editor:\nClick Edit Global JavaScript to open the JavaScript editor. If you’ve already added code, it will appear here; if not, you can start from scratch.\n  Add or Modify Code:\nWrite or paste your JavaScript. You can define functions, create event listeners, or even hook into Ember’s initialization sequence. For example:\nfunction testClick() {  alert(\"Testing a button click\"); }  // Ember app hooks for advanced integration window.kiandaApp = {  init: function (app) {  app.boot().then(async () =\u003e {  var appInstance = app.__container__.owner;  var session = appInstance.lookup(\"service:session\");  var store = appInstance.lookup(\"service:store\");  // Add custom logic here if needed  });  },  didInit: function(appInstance) {  // Fires after the app has initialized  // Ideal place for actions that require a fully loaded environment  } };   Save and Apply Changes:\nClick OK, then Save Changes in the Subscription Details page. After saving, refresh your workspace to ensure the new code is loaded globally.\n  Use the Generated URL (If Needed):\nA URL is generated for the Global JavaScript file. Typically, you don’t need to reference this URL directly within Kianda, but it’s available for troubleshooting or external references.\n  Best Practices  Keep it organized: Group related functions together and comment your code, so it’s easier to maintain as your workspace grows. Use namespaces: To avoid naming conflicts, consider wrapping related functions in a single object or namespace. For example: window.myCompanyUtils = {  setHeader: function(elementId, text) {  const headerElement = document.getElementById(elementId);  if (headerElement) {  headerElement.innerHTML = text;  }  } };  Embrace Ember hooks: The window.kiandaApp object gives you direct access to Ember’s lifecycle. Use init or didInit to run code at startup, obtain services, or dynamically modify application behavior. Leverage jQuery/Vanilla JS: Kianda includes jQuery, but you can also use modern JavaScript APIs (document.querySelector, etc.). Prefer modern APIs when possible for cleaner, more performant code.  Example: Dynamic Interaction with a Dashboard Here’s a more detailed example of a global function that updates a dashboard header based on a user’s selection in a dropdown:\nfunction setHeader(elementId) {  // Assuming the dropdown has a Kendo UI component or a similar API  var dropdown = $('filter.dropdown [data-role=dropdownlist]').data(\"kendoDropDownList\");   dropdown.bind(\"cascade\", function () {  var selectedText = dropdown.text();  var headerElement = document.getElementById(elementId);  if (headerElement) {  headerElement.innerHTML = selectedText;  }  }); } How This Helps:\nWhen a user selects a new filter in the dropdown, setHeader runs automatically (after binding), updating the displayed header dynamically. This logic can be easily reused in multiple dashboards or pages—just call setHeader with the correct element ID in each case.\nAdditional Ideas  Data formatting functions: Create global helpers for formatting dates, numbers, or strings consistently across all processes. Event-based logic: Attach global event listeners to window or document, and run specific functions in response to custom events fired within Kianda. Complex integrations: Use fetch or AJAX calls to integrate with external APIs, then store or display the returned data in various parts of your workspace.   In summary, the Global JavaScript file in Kianda is your toolbox. By placing commonly used functions, event handlers, and Ember lifecycle hooks here, you maintain a cleaner, more efficient codebase and give yourself the flexibility to implement custom logic throughout your workspace with minimal repetition.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"The Global JavaScript file in Kianda gives you a central place to add …","ref":"/low-code/global-javascript/","tags":"","title":"Global JavaScript file"},{"body":"This video demonstrates ways of setting default owners for a form, levels of process user access and where to leave comments for process users.\nYour browser does not support the video tag.

Pages offer easy reporting, permissions management, quick build, condition-based filtering and many more useful features.\nFrom lists to tiles, filters and charts, dashboards allow you to build full digital experiences to monitor your real-time processes in a few minutes.\nThere are 3 steps involved in creating a dashboard:\n Create a page. Add one or more widgets. Configure or edit the widgets to make the page look the way you want.  This page covers how to create, edit, and delete dashboards and give an overview of how to add widgets to a page.\nIf you are using Kianda predefined processes from the App Store, then dashboards have already been created for you! These are available by clicking on Dashboard from the main side menu or left-hand pane.\nBefore you begin, it is important to be aware that there are two modes involved in dashboard pages, an Edit mode and View mode as described below.\nEdit mode and View mode When using dashboards, there are two modes: Edit mode and View mode.\nView mode When you are in View mode, the Edit button will be visible to the right in the top menu bar.\nEdit mode When you click on the Edit current page button you will be in Edit mode. When you are viewing a page in Edit mode, these options will be available to you along the top of the dashboard page:\n the Widget menu where you can insert any of the seven available dashboard widgets the Settings button to make changes to the dashboard page the Bin/Trash button to delete the dashboard page the Add layout container button to add a layout container to the dashboard page in order to organise the widgets on the page and achieve the layout you want three buttons on each widget on the dashboard that allow you to edit the options relating to that widget type (Update configuration), edit the widget settings (Update widget settings) or delete the widget from the dashboard (Remove widget)  If you want to create a dashboard page from scratch go to How to create a dashboard page or if you want to learn more about dashboard widgets go to Dashboard widgets.\nHow to create a page Kianda offers a user-friendly interface to create dashboards in minutes. This video covers the steps for creating a new dashboard:\nYour browser does not support the video tag.   To create a new Dashboard page:\n  Click on Home in the left-hand pane\n  Click on the Create a new page icon   A Create dashboard page dialog box will open, allowing you to choose from a range of options for your new dashboard page:\n  The options in the Create dashboard page dialog box include:\n  Title - The title of the dashboard page. You can insert whatever title you want - for example, ‘Training Requests’.\n  Name - This is a unique name for the dashboard.\n  Visible to - You can decide who will be able see the dashboard. You can select single or multiple users or Groups or a combination of the two (as shown here):\nNote: Levels of Security\n  Dashboard-level security can only be applied if you are an Administrator and can set the visibility of dashboards and widgets. The dashboard page-level security you are setting here - who can see the dashboard page - will override any security you set for the visibility of individual widgets on that dashboard. See Dashboard security and Widget security for more information.\n  Widget security: You will also be able to set security for each of the individual widgets that you add to the dashboard, i.e. who can view each dashboard widget.\n    Icon - You can choose an icon for your dashboard page from a drop-down list of hundreds of available icons.\nThe icon you select will appear next to the dashboard title when you click on Dashboard in the left side menu to view all of the available dashboards:\n  Sort order - Choose a numeric value - by either typing it into the field or by clicking on the up down arrows at the right of the field - for the place you want this dashboard to go in terms of the order of the dashboard pages in your main left side menu.\n  Group - You can choose to group this dashboard as a sub-page of an existing dashboard page. If you want to do this, insert the name of the dashboard page you want to group this new dashboard page under.\n  Enable favourites - Select this checkbox if you want to insert an ‘Add to favourites’ button to the top menu in the dashboard.\nOnce you complete the Create dashboard page dialog box and click OK, and then click the Save button in the top dashboard menu, a new ‘Add to favourites’ button will be added to your top dashboard menu:\nIf you want to add the current dashboard to your favourites:\n  Click the Add to favourites button   Complete the Add to favourite dialog box that opens and then click the Add favourite button to add this dashboard to your favourites (or click Close to cancel adding it to your favourites):\n  If you click ‘Add favourite’, the dialog box will close and a pop-up message will display saying ‘Favourite saved successfully’. A new star icon will now appear next to this dashboard page in the Dashboards menu in the main left side menu (denoting that it is a favourite page).\n     Click on the OK button when you are have completed the Create dashboard page dialog box (or click on Close to close the dialog box and cancel the creation of the new dashboard page).\n  The output is a menu with a number of widgets available that you can add to the dashboard.\nNote: To add a widget to a dashboard, simply click on the widget type from the widget menu when you are in Edit mode. See How to add layout containers to a Dashboard page and How to add widgets to a Dashboard page to learn more, and go to Dashboard widgets to find out more about each widget type.\n  Click on the Save button in the top menu to save any changes you make to the new Dashboard page - a pop-up message saying ‘Page saved successfully’ will display.\nAlternatively, if you don’t want to save the changes you’ve made to the page, click on the Stop editing page button to return to View mode without saving changes:\n  You are now in View mode. To make further changes to the dashboard page, return to Edit mode by clicking on the Edit button in the top menu.\n  How to delete a Dashboard page   Click on the Edit current page button to go into Edit mode.\n  Click on the Trash/Bin icon .\n  A Delete page dialog box will open:\n  Click on OK to confirm that you want to delete the dashboard page (or click on Cancel to cancel the deletion).\n  Click on the Save button in the top dashboard menu to save the changes to the page.\n  How to add layout containers to a Dashboard page A layout container is a simple way to organise, arrange the page layout using a bootstrap columns layout style and move the widgets you add to your dashboard. It works in a way that is similar to how a Panel layout control is used in a form to organise the fields in a form.\nTo add a layout container to a Dashboard:\n  Click on the Edit current page button to go into Edit mode.\n  Click the green Add layout container button at the bottom right of the dashboard page.\n  Complete the Create a layout container dialog box that opens by inserting a name and then selecting the width you want for the layout container (by selecting how wide the blue bar is):\n  Note:\n  If you know the layout you want for your Dashboard, in terms of what widgets you want to put where, and how large you want the various widgets to be, insert layout containers before you start adding widgets to your dashboard page. Then, when you insert each widget, you can choose which layout container you want to assign it to when you are creating the widget.\n  Alternatively, if you aren’t sure what widgets you are going to add or what layout you want for your dashboard, you can simply start adding widgets to your dashboard without any layout containers. Once you have added the widgets to the dashboard, you can either drag and drop the widgets to get the dashboard page layout you want or you can go back and insert layout containers and assign widgets to those containers but clicking on the Update widget settings button for each widget.\n  For example, for this existing widget, by opening the Edit widget dialog box, we can now choose to assign it to any of the four available layout containers:\nHow to edit and delete a layout container To edit a layout container:\n  Find the layout container you would like to edit and click on the Edit layout container button in the bottom left corner of the layout container.\n  In the Create a layout container dialog box, apply any necessary changes to the fields.\n  When finished click on OK to confirm your changes, or click on Close to cancel your changes.\n  Click on the Save button in the top dashboard menu to save the changes to the page.\n  To delete a layout container:\n Find the layout container you would like to edit and click on the Delete button . Click on the Save button in the top dashboard menu to save the changes to the page.  The widgets that were previously within that layout container will then be appended to the end of the dashboard page.\n  How to add widgets to a Dashboard page To add a widget to a Dashboard page:\n  Click on the Edit current page button to go into Edit mode.\n  If you know the layout you want for your Dashboard, click the green Add layout container button to create a layout container or several layout containers. See How to add layout containers to a Dashboard page.\n  Click on the type of widget you want to insert, from the seven available widget types in the dashboard widgets menu.\n  Complete the relevant dialog boxes for the widget type you have chosen. To learn more, go to Dashboard widgets and click on the widget type you want to add to your dashboard to find out more about it.\n  Once you have added your widget(s), click on the Save button in the top dashboard menu to save the changes to the page.\n  Dashboard widgets Kianda comes with 7 predefined dashboard widgets that you can add to a dashboard page once you are in Edit mode. Using these widgets, you can quickly and easily create a process dashboard in minutes.\nTo learn more about each widget type and how to add it to a dashboard, click on the name of the widget:\n  Rich Text widget: The Rich Text widget can be used to display text, links or images in a dashboard.\n  Tile widget: The Tile widget can be used to display a count of instances with different colour schemes. You could also add conditions to a display count - for example, you could add a condition of “Status” equals “In-progress” so that the count of process instances with a status of “In-progress” is displayed.\n  Chart widget: Using a Chart widget, you could display a pie chart, bar chart or a line chart in your dashboard. These charts can be used to represent various conditions in a process.\n  List widget: The List widget displays the instances (individual records) of the selected process. It can also be used to connect with any other widget to display the filtered items.\n  Filter widget: The Filter widget can be used to filter process instances based on a field. For example, process instances could be filtered by status.\n  Link widget: The Link widget can be used to add a link to a new process, dashboard or any external sources (such as SharePoint or a website).\n  Walk-through widget: The Walk-through widget allows you to create a walk-through of a process quickly which could be made available to a user, group or organisation.\n  When you have added one or more dashboard widgets, you can move the widgets around the dashboard page using the Drag handle button. This is possible when you are in Edit mode, see Edit mode and View mode.\nHow to edit Dashboard page settings To edit a Dashboard page:\n  Click on the Edit current page button to go into Edit mode.\n  Click on the Settings button .\n  An Edit dashboard page dialog box opens:\n  The options available are the same as those available in the Create dashboard page dialog box used to create a new dashboard page - see How to create a dashboard page - but there are also two additional options:\n  Display in mobile footer - Select this checkbox to display a link to the dashboard in the footer of a mobile phone when the Kianda workspace is accessed on a mobile. Here we can see the example of a link to a dashboard page called ‘Staff onboarding’ available in the footer of a mobile phone:\n  Hide from navigation - Select this checkbox if you want to hide this dashboard from the navigation in the left side menu.\nNote: Selecting this option will override whatever options you may have inserted in the ‘Visible to’ option in the Create dashboard page dialog box (which allows you to restrict who can see the dashboard). Selecting Hide from navigation will mean the dashboard page will not be visible to anyone in the main side menu.\n   Click on the Version history information button to view the version history of the dashboard. This allows you to view the current dashboard version as well as all the previously saved dashboard versions, when they were modified, and by who they were saved. Clicking on the Restore page version button allows you to rollback to that version, which changes all the current dashboard widgets and settings to reflect the version selected. It should be noted that when rolling back to a previous version for example version 2.0 from version 5.0, you can still restore a version that succeeds version 2.0 if necessary as the version numbers are incremental.\n  Click on the OK button to save the changes you have made in the Edit dashboard page dialog box (or click on Close to exit the dialog box without saving).\n  Click on the Save button in the top dashboard menu to save the changes to the page.\n  Enabling data export from dashboards Kianda allows users to export the data from dashboards with a simple click.\nThis video explains how to set up the configuration to export data from dashboards:\nYour browser does not support the video tag.   Offline availability Kianda is a progressive web application. This enables Kianda dashboards to provide insights to the business processes, even in offline mode.\nThis can be beneficial for businesses with users who will need to complete forms when their device is offline - for example, a business with users who carry out inspections or maintenance in remote locations with no access to the internet. While working offline, the user can still create new process instances or carry out actions on an existing instance.\nSaving changes Make sure to save any changes you make to your Dashboard by clicking on the Save button .\nWhat’s next  We have briefly introduced Kianda Dashboards. Now let’s look at each of available Dashboard widgets - and Conditions that can be applied to some of them - in more detail:\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Kianda pages deliver a convenient way to provide insights into how …","ref":"/platform/pages/","tags":"","title":"Pages"},{"body":"Introduction The Process security rule dynamically changes the security settings of a process instance.\nSecurity settings for a process can be set statically by going to Settings for the process in Kianda Designer. If you check the checkbox for Enable process security, you can then select users, groups, and/or partners and set their access level, see Process settings for more details.\nThis setting is static and applies to every instance of the process. However the Process security rule is dynamic and changes the security settings for a particular instance. For example if there is a Finance process with a Payroll request form containing personal data like employee salary, this request form should only be visible to an assigned person. An Assign form rule could be used to give form ownership to an assigned person, allowing them to edit the form in a process instance, and if the rule is combined with the Process security rule then only the assigned person can view the request form for the process instance.\nIf there are multiple process instances listed in a dashboard, then process security will allow only those who have the designated access, to view those process instances.\nWhen to use You can add this rule:\n to a field to a form to a process (the rule will run on load)  How to get started To dynamically set security for process instances:\n  Click on an existing process by going to Administration \u003e Designer and decide which form, or field you will apply the rule to, by clicking on that item so that it is in edit mode so you can see the Edit/pen button, Pen button .\n  Click on Add a rule \u003e Workflow \u003e Process security.\n  In the Edit rule - Process security dialog box, give the rule a title in the Title field.\n  If you want to add conditions for the rule, click on the Edit conditions button to create conditions for the rule, see Conditions for more details.\n  Under Action, create one or more actions for the rule by filling out the following:\n  Add to process security users - choose from the radio buttons:\n Any user - choose from Users, Groups and/or Partners in the drop-down list. All users and groups must be predefined in the system, see Users and Groups for more details. Partners must also be predefined within the Invite partners section under Administration. Current user - make the current user of the form, whoever is submitting or saving information, as the person that is added to the form process security. Defined in a user field - choose a user picker field from the process, where the selected users, groups or partners will be added to the form process security. Form owner(s) - selecting this option means that the form owner(s) defined during form creation/editing will be added to the form process security, see Form owners for more details on what form ownership is and how to create form owners.    Depending on the option chosen for Add to process security users, different fields will display:\n  For example if Any user is chosen, then a Select user(s) field appears as shown in the image above. Choose from Users, Groups and/or Partners.\n  If Defined in a user field or Form owner(s) is chosen then a Select form field appears prompting you to select a user picker field for the former, and a form with form owners for the latter.\n    Existing user(s) - choose from:\n Override - this means that this rule will override form ownership, making those referenced in the Edit rule dialog box the form owners. Append - this means that for a current list of form owners, for example those defined during form creation, that list will be appended with any users referenced in the Edit rule dialog box.    Override security settings - choose from Yes or No.\n  If you choose Yes then a checkbox appears allowing you to Enable security.\n  If you check the checkbox, then you can choose the Process security mode which lists the following options:\n Security users can create, assign to, can update, everyone else can view - this is the lowest level of security, allowing the assigned user(s) the ability to view, edit and assign process instances, while others can view the process instances. Security users can create, assign to, can view and update - this allows the assigned user(s) the ability to view, edit and assign process instances.

For example if you have access to a file stored in the cloud and have the URL, you can use this URL to download the file from the internet and place it in a file field with a name. The name you give to the downloaded file must contain the extension, for example if the file stored in the cloud is a PDF file and you want the name of the file to be “Workbook”, then you need to set the name of the file to Workbook.pdf. You must provide the correct extension for the file otherwise the created file will not be downloadable.\nWhen to use Use this rule when your process requires you to bring an existing file that you have a link to but not the file itself. For example if you have a link that leads to a file that is stored in a SharePoint datasource, you can bring this file into your process by using this rule and storing it in a file field.\nYou can add this rule:\n to a field to a form to a process (the rule will run on load)  Before you get started In advance of using the Set existing file rule, in your process you need to have created at least one or more forms.

Tables can include different types of fields, such as text boxes, date fields, number fields, and list fields.\nFor example, in a Purchase Order Request form, you may want to use a Table field to display certain information about items or suppliers and/or to capture details the user inputs about items being ordered. In addition, you could apply rules to some of the fields within the table to, for example, automatically calculate totals or percentages or to pull in data from external data sources.\nFor more information about applying rules to fields and forms go to Rules and for more specific information about applying rules to Table fields see Table rules.\nWe will now go through:\n How to add a Table field to a form How to edit column fields in a Table How to change the title of a Table colulmn How to delete a column from a Table How to change the field type of an existing Table column How to insert new columns in a Table How to move columns in a Table How to edit the Table field How to move Table fields How to delete Table fields How to edit Table field properties  How to get started   To add a Table field to a form, first open the relevant process.\n  Then select the form within that process that you want to add the field to (so that the Edit Form button is visible).\n  Click on Controls in the left-hand pane to expand the Controls menu.\n  Select Input to view the range of Input controls and click on Table.\nA Table field will be added to your form with the default title of ‘’Table 1’’ and a pop-up message will say ‘Field added’.\nBy default, the new Table field will have one row with two columns of text fields, titled Text 1 and Text 2. You can add rows, columns and various different types of fields to the table by editing the table field, as outlined in the next section. In the example shown here, a new table has been added to a form called ‘Training Request’.\n  How to edit, move and delete Table fields As we go through the options available for editing a Table, we will keep in mind the example of the table we added to the ‘Training Request’ form above.\nHow to edit column fields in a Table First, decide how many columns you need in your table and what type of input field you want to use for each column. To learn more about the eight different types of Input fields that you can use, go to Input controls.\nIn our example, we want to change the default table that was inserted - titled Table 1 with two columns of text box fields - into a table called ‘Existing Qualifications’ to capture the existing qualifications of the user who is requesting further training.\nWe want our table to have three columns: the first column will be a text box field titled ‘Qualification Description’ where the user will manually type in the name of a qualification, the second column will be a drop-down list titled ‘Educational Institution’ (which could link to an external data source) where the user will choose the relevant institution, and the third column will be a date field titled ‘Date Qualification Obtained’, as shown here:\nHow to change the title of a Table column To change the default title of the first column texbox field from Text 1:\n Select that field by either clicking on the field title or by clicking into the blank text box so that the Edit field button (Pen icon) displays. Click the Edit field button.  The Edit field - Text dialog box will open and you can change the title of the field here. There are also a number of other options available to you - see Text box control for more information on how you can edit text box fields.\nNote: The unique names of fields outside of a table do not conflict with the unique names of fields within a table.

By default, this option is set to ‘Yes’.\n  Enable removing rows - selecting ‘Yes’ enables the user to remove rows from the table as they are completing it (by clicking on the Bin/Trash button at the end of each table row) and selecting ‘No’ removes this option. By default, this option is set to ‘Yes’.\n  Show row count - you can choose to display text showing the number of rows in the table. This text will appear below the Add row button:\n  Enable sorting - you can select ‘Yes’ to enable the form user to sort the data in the table\n  Enable search - you can select ‘Yes’ to enable the form user to search the data in the table. If you choose this option, the form user will see a search field at the top of the table:\n  Add first row onload - by default, this is set to ‘Yes’, meaning that when the form is loaded the first row is automatically shown.\n  Enable export to csv - you can select ‘Yes’ to enable the form user to export the table contents to a csv file. If you select ‘Yes’, some additional options appear in the Edit field - Table dialog box:\nThe CSV Separator is set to be a comma by default (but you can change this) and you can insert text you want to appear on the Export CSV button. For example, if you insert ‘Export to CSV’ as the text to appear on the button, it will appear like this in the form to the user:\nThe Columns to export will automatically show the columns in your table\n  Make whatever changes you want to make to the table in the Edit field - Table dialog box and then click OK to confirm.\nIf you want to make your table more dynamic - for example, so that calculations are made or information is autofilled into part of the table - you can add rules to it. To learn about applying rules to fields and forms go to Rules and for more specific information about applying rules to Table fields see Table rules.\n  How to move Table fields To move a Table field within your form:\n Select the field’s Drag handle button . Drag and drop the field wherever you want to move it to.  How to delete Table fields To delete a Table field from your form:\n Select the field (by either clicking on the field’s name or its Drag handle button ). Click on the Bin/Trash button .

This means that as your processes are running, they will use the information from the local file system or depending on the process, update or delete information at the local file system location. Kianda has the ability to extract files, navigate subfolders and write new files into the directory, this includes local file and internet file systems.\nUsing this type of datasource is useful when you want Kianda to have access to your directory, to extract and read files as well as writing files to the directory.\nHow to get started   From the Kianda home page, click on Administration \u003e Data sources.\n  Click on + Add new button and choose File system from the list of data sources provided.\n  You will be automatically brought to the File system details page, where you can start setting up the connection.\nChoose from the edit options:\n Display name - type in the name for your file system connector. This is used to distinguish between different data connectors on your platform. Root folder path - type in manually the file path to the folder of your connector, for example C:\\Documents\\GreenITR. The connector will be able to access data only in this folder and folders within. File search pattern - this options can be used to limit the type of files for interaction, by using file extensions. For example typing in *.txt will only output the .txt files within the folder path, it will ignore all other path endings and will not display them. To set pattern you need to type in * followed by .extenstion for example *.txt , *.docx or *.pdf Search options - this only allows you to search the files of the top directory that is set in the Root folder path or all other files of other directories within.  For example selecting if Top Directory Only is selected, you will be able to see only the files that are in Root folder path while ignoring folders, meaning that no subdirectories can be navigated. If All Directories is selected, you will be able to see files that are in Root folder path and all files from within each folder, or subfolders.   Use Kianda Cloud Connect - by default this option is enabled and cannot be changed, the cloud connect is needed to create a connection between the local file system and Kianda itself. This lightweight app will sit on the PC or server where the files reside.

This widget is typically used to filter data in other dashboard widgets, for example, a List Widget, so your filter choice will influence how the list widget displays. You can use the filter to search for specific type of data within other widgets helping you to breakdown information without having to look for it manually.\nYou can create four types of filters:\n  Manual/datasource filter - this filter will allow you to search for data by selecting an option which can be entered in manually or pulled from a datasource. There are two styles of manual/datasource filters: a Dropdown or a Radio list:\n  Date range filter - this filter allows you to enter two sets of dates which can be then used to filter your data based on a date input in a connected dashboard widget.\n  Free text filter - this filter allows you to filter data in a connected dashboard widget by typing text freely into the search bar.\nNote: by default you are required to connect this filter to another dashboard widget so that the filter knows which widget your are searching for data.\n  Current user filter - this filter allows you to pull a profile attribute from the currently logged in user which can be then used to filter data in another dashboard widget. For example you can pull the display name attribute from the user and based on that, you could filter data in other widgets that belong to the current user. To learn more about users and profile attributes visit Modify profile attributes.\n  How to get started To add a Filter widget to a dashboard:\n  Open the relevant dashboard page. To learn how to create your first dashboard page, go to How to create a dashboard page.\n  Click on the Edit current page button from the top dashboard menu to go into Dashboards Edit mode (in which the Widget menu, Settings button , Bin/Trash button and Add layout container button are available):\n  Click on the Filter widget button in the Dashboard Widget menu.\n  The Add widget dialog box opens with a range of options for your new Filter widget.\nChoose the options you want:\n  Title - You can insert the title you want for your Filter widget (instead of the default title that is shown).\n  Layout columns - You can choose how wide you want your Filter widget to be. You can choose from 1 to 12 columns in width by clicking on the blue bar. For example click half-way across the blue bar to create a widget that is 6 columns wide, or click to the very end of the bar to create a column that is 12 columns wide.\n  Colour scheme - You can choose from six colour options for the header of the widget (Navy, Green, Blue, Amber, Red or White), if you choose to display it.\n  Show header - You can choose whether or not you want the header of your widget to be shown when the dashboard is not in edit mode. This checkbox is selected by default, so de-select it if you don’t want the header to be displayed.\n  Visible to - You can choose who will be able to see the Filter widget. Select single or multiple Users or Groups, or a combination of the two. You can use the menu on the right to either filter the drop-down list by Users or Groups. To find out more about pre-defined Groups on Kianda, go to Users \u0026 Groups.\n  Note - Dashboard page security: When a dashboard page is first created, the users(s)/group(s) who will be able to view the dashboard are selected in the ‘Visible to’ option in the Create dashboard page dialog box (see Step 3 in How to create a Dashboard page).\nYou can also edit or update this setting at any point to change who has permission to view a particular dashboard page. This higher dashboard-level security setting will take precedence over the security settings (‘Visible to’) that are applied to the individual widgets within the dashboard (such as the Filter widget, in this case).\nSee Dashboard security and Widget security for more information.\n    Layout container: This option will only display if you have already created layout containers for your Dashboard page. Here, you can select the layout container you want to place your new Filter widget in.\nA layout container is a simple way to organise, arrange and move the widgets you add to your dashboard. To learn more about layout containers, go to How to add layout containers to a Dashboard page.\n  Device visibility - You can choose what devices and types of internet connections the dashboard Filter widget will be visible on - select all the options you want from Desktop, Tablet, Mobile, Wi-Fi and Flight mode as to when the device can view the dashboards. By default, all options are selected.\n    Click on OK when you’ve completed the Add widget dialog box. A Filter settings dialog will open automatically:\n  How to create a Manual/datasource filter   First, follow the steps in How to get started to create a filter widget or edit an existing filter, to edit an existing filter, see How to edit Filter widgets.\n  In the Filter settings dialog, select Dropdown list or Radio list as your Filter type.\n  In the Filter options select from:\n  Manual entries - this option will provide you a text box in which you can specify your filter options. Each option needs to be on a separate line of the text box, see image below:\nYour filter will display filter options in a different manner depending on the style you choose: Dropdown or Radio list. Dropdown list displays one additional setting (explained below).\n  Data source - once you select this option, additional settings will appear:\n  Datasource button - this button will allow you to connect to datasource which will allow you to pull the filter options. For example, you can connect to a SharePoint list that contains all your filter options or any other datasource that has been created within your system. See Data connectors for a full list of datasources you can create.\n  Edit condition button - this button allows you to create a condition to pull data from the datasource, once the condition is matched the data will be pulled from the datasource. See Conditions to learn more.\n  Display field \u0026 Value field - Display field will be the option visible to the user while the Value field will be the actual value when the option is selected. For example, if you are pulling your filter options form a SharePoint list which has multiple columns, you can select one of those columns to be displayed for the user and use another column for the value. To further extend the example, you could have the display field set to a username (title) and in the background pull the users role as the value.\n      If you choose to create Dropdown list filter, an additional option in the settings will be required to fill out:\n Filter mode - this options will allow you to search either the beginning of a string by selecting Starts With or by selecting Contains, the filter will search if the chosen option is contained in a string.    You can set a default value of your filter by typing one of your options into the Default value text box. This means that whenever your dashboard is loaded, the text you enter in the Default value will be automatically set as the default option.\n  Enable query string - check this checkbox if you wish to include a query string when filtering data. When enabled, an additional textbox will appear under the Default value textbox:\nType the name of your parameter into the textbox provided (where the place holder says “Parameter name”). Check the Auto update URL checkbox to allow the URL be updated automatically when you select an option. To learn more about query strings within Kianda, visit Query Strings and for an additional example of query strings within the Filter widget, visit Filter Widget Query Strings.\n  Control placeholder - if you select Dropdown list as your filter type, an additional text field will appear called Control placeholder. The text entered here will appear as the placeholder text for your dropdown filter.\n  Click on Add connection to connect your filter to another dashboard widget which you want to target while filtering data based on the option selected.\n  Click on the Widget dropdown list to select an existing dashboard widget. Once a widget is selected a Data source filter button will appear.\n  Data source filter button is used to create a condition. Once this condition is met, the connected widget will then display data that matches the condition.\n​\n The left dropdown is the value from the widget you’re connecting to, while the right most textbox is the value chosen in the filter.      Confirm your settings of the filter by clicking OK on all dialog boxes and click on save dashboard button to see all changes to the filter widget.\n  How to create a Date range filter   First, follow the steps in How to get started to create a filter widget or edit an existing filter, to edit an existing filter, see How to edit Filter widgets.\n  In the Filter settings dialog, select Date range as your Filter type.\n  In the filter options select a Date format, once your date range filter is set up, the filter will allow you to:\n  Date - allows you to select a date from a date picker.\n  Date and time - allows you to select a date from a date picker and a time from a time picker.\n    Click on Add connection to connect your filter to another dashboard widget which you want to target while filtering data based on the date selected.\n  Click on the Widget dropdown list to select an existing dashboard widget. Once a widget is selected a Data source filter button will appear.\n  Data source filter button is used to create a condition. Once this condition is met, the connected widget will then display data that matches the condition. Note that because you are using a date filter, the widget you are targeting must contain a date value. See the below image of a condition that allows us to filter a last modified date field (available in common fields of each process instance) between the range of our two inputs on List widget which is attached to a process.\nIn the image below, you can see that the list only displays process instances between the dates we provided in the date filter.\n    Confirm your settings of the filter by clicking OK on all dialog boxes and click on save dashboard button to see all changes to the date filter widget.\n  How to create Free text filter   First, follow the steps in How to get started to create a filter widget or edit an existing filter, to edit an existing filter, see How to edit Filter widgets.\n  In the Filter settings dialog, select Free text as your Filter type.\n  You can set a default value of your filter by typing one into the Default value text box. This means that whenever your dashboard is loaded, the text you enter in the Default value will be automatically set as the default option. If you don’t need a default value, you can also create a placeholder by typing text into the placeholder provided:\n  Enable query string - check this checkbox if you wish to include a query string when filtering data.

This …","ref":"/platform/pages/filter/","tags":"","title":"Filter widget"},{"body":"The List widget is a powerful dashboard component that displays process records or instances in an organized, visual format. For example, a “Training Requests” list can show each request’s ID, status, and the employee’s name who submitted it—all in one convenient place:\nYou can configure the List widget with no-code steps—such as filtering data, displaying specific fields, and enabling sorting or search features. For details, see Configure your widget.\nHowever, to truly make the widget your own, you can customize it using HTML and Handlebars templates. This approach lets you change its look and feel, add icons, or even integrate dynamic behavior. In the following sections, we’ll walk you through how to get started with these customizations.\nHow to Get Started with List Widget Customization As with any of Kianda’s predefined dashboard widgets, you can add a List widget to your dashboard with just a few clicks. For details on adding widgets, see How to add widgets to a dashboard page.\nThe standard List widget already provides extensive configuration options—like conditions, sorting, and filtering—that leverage both design fields and Kianda’s built-in process fields. Yet, if you have an Administrator role, you can take this further by customizing how the List widget displays its data:\n  Go to an existing dashboard page or create a new one. Click Edit current page to enter Edit mode.\n  Add a new List widget from the dashboard widget menu if none exists, or edit an existing one by clicking its Edit/pen icon.\n  In the Edit widget dialog, configure the widget by selecting which fields to display and how you’d like the data to appear. For guidance, see Configure your widget.\n  Once your fields are selected, click on List fields in the Edit widget dialog. Here, you’ll find two important buttons:\n Add column: Lets you add a new column with custom HTML or Handlebars code. Add action: Lets you attach a button to trigger rules or actions from the dashboard.    Add column :\nClicking this opens a code editor where you can customize the presentation of your data. Insert HTML, Handlebars expressions, and even Font Awesome icons for visual cues. You can also hide a column if needed.\nFor example:\n\u003cdiv class=\"panel panel-primary\"\u003e \u003cbutton class=\"btn btn-warning\"\u003e {{#if (eq row.properties.InternalStatus \"completed\")}}\u003cspan class=\"fa fa-check-circle\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e {{else if (eq row.properties.InternalStatus \"PO Request\")}}\u003cspan class=\"fa fa-question-circle\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e {{else if (eq row.properties.InternalStatus \"Approval\")}}\u003cspan class=\"fa fa-thumbs-up\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e {{else if (eq row.properties.InternalStatus \"Supplier Invoice\")}}\u003cspan class=\"fa fa-newspaper-o\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e {{else if (eq row.properties.InternalStatus \"Payment\")}}\u003cspan class=\"fa fa-money\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e {{/if}}\u003c/button\u003e \u003c/div\u003e   Add action :\nUse this feature to add a dashboard button that, when clicked, triggers specific rules or actions associated with a field in the underlying process. For example, you could re-run a “Submit” action even after a process instance is complete.\nChoose a field or rule to trigger, assign an icon, and pick a button color. Your dashboard users will then be able to perform these actions directly from the list.\n  After making your changes, click OK to confirm. Then save your dashboard page changes by clicking the Save button . You’ll see a “Page saved successfully” message.\n  Example of List Widget Customization In the sample code above, we used Handlebars logic ({{#if}} conditions) to display different Font Awesome icons depending on the process instance’s status. For instance:\n PO Request: Shows a question-circle icon. Approval: Shows a thumbs-up icon. Supplier Invoice: Shows a newspaper icon. Payment: Shows a money icon. Completed: Shows a check-circle icon.  Since Kianda already loads Font Awesome, you can easily map different icons to different states, giving users a quick visual cue about each record’s progress.\nWhen you follow the steps described and apply code via Add column, your dashboard might look like this:\nYou can also use JavaScript to enhance the widget’s functionality. For example, you could write custom actions in your Global JavaScript file (see Global JavaScript file) and then call them from within the Handlebars template. This flexibility means you’re not limited to static displays—you can introduce interactivity and dynamic content tailored to your specific requirements.\n By blending Kianda’s built-in configuration options with custom HTML, Handlebars templating, and JavaScript actions, you can create a List widget that perfectly suits your reporting and visualization needs. This approach keeps development simple (just like regular front-end work) while unlocking a rich set of possibilities for your business dashboards.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"The List widget is a powerful dashboard component that displays …","ref":"/low-code/list-widget-template/","tags":"","title":"List widget template customisation"},{"body":"Introduction The Merge PDF rule allows you to combine two or more .pdf files together.

An Input mapping section allows you to map values for fields from the primary process to the secondary/target process fields, read more below.\n  A Table mapping section allows you to map values from a table(s) in the primary process to the secondary/target process table(s), see below.\n  Use On success mapping to retrieve values from the secondary process, showing success in process execution. Click on the link to read more.\n  The remaining options in the Edit rule dialog box are explained below.\n  Click OK when you are finished editing the dialog box, or Close at any time to exit the dialog box.\n  Input mapping For Input mapping you can map field values from one process to another. For example in an ‘Onboarding HR process’, if a user fills out their name in a Name field, then that name/value will be mapped to a field in a form in the secondary/target process ‘Send email process’ called New request Name as shown in the example below. Your forms must already have precreated fields to capture the values from process or user input.\nTo use Input mapping, click on the blue bar for Input mapping:\n  The process names will automatically appear in the left and right columns once a process design is selected from the drop-down list, see step 5 in How to get started above. Within each field, choose a form and then a field that you would like to map the values from one process to another. Alternatively, you can type in text to pass from the primary process to a field in the secondary process.\n  Click on the Bin/Trash button to delete a mapping.\n  Click on the Add mapping button to add further mappings from the secondary/target process to the primary process. Ensure that form fields are already precreated to hold these values.\n  Table mapping If you use a table in your process you can map fields from a table in one process to another in a similar way to the fields in Input mapping, but this section includes additional parameters to give you a range of options.\nTo use table mapping, you must already have tables created in your primary and secondary processes. Then click on the blue bar for Table mapping:\n  The process names will automatically appear in the left and right columns once a process design is selected from the drop-down list, see step 5 in How to get started above.\n  Click on Add table mapping to and add input and output tables for each process. Click on a form and then a table of choice.\n  Click on the ellipsis button to open the Table mappings dialog box.\nOptions within this dialog box are:\n  Operation - choose from:\n  Copy rows which allows you to copy row data from one process to another. You can also add conditions to the copying process by clicking on Copy row conditions to allow you to have conditions on which rows are copied over to the target process. We can add fields or text to the conditions. Click on Conditions to read more about conditions in Kianda.\nIf you click on the Action button then column titles from the primary and secondary processes are automatically listed under Column mapping as shown below, where Need and Reason are column headings in the table in the primary process and Customer need and Reason given are column headings in the table in the secondary/target process. In the example below, a condition has been set so that if Need equals the text ‘Broadband connection’ then the values input into the columns listed will be copied over.\n  Update rows - if you choose Update rows then contents of the target process table will be updated. Similar to copy rows, an Update row conditions button appears allowing you to set conditions for what content is updated. As with Copy row conditions you can set conditions to control how values are mapped from one process to another.\nAn Action button is available beside Column mapping to allow you to autofill field names from processes under Field or text and To table fields.\n      Click on the Bin/Trash button to delete a mapping.\n  Click on the Add table mapping button to add more tables.\n  On success mapping If you wish to update an existing process instance you can use mapping within the On success mapping section to retrieve the Process ID of that process instance, and then trigger rules in the target process instance. A text box field within the form can be created to hold the Process ID value, see Before getting started. The ID for the existing process instance, is one of the Common fields that can be pulled from the system.\nTo use On success mapping:\n  Click on the green bar of On success mapping to reveal primary and secondary/target process form fields. For example in the image below, the primary process is called Onboarding HR and the secondary process is called Send email process. Both of these appear automatically below when the green bar is clicked on.\n From here you can choose to add in form fields, for example a text box field called Sales Onboarding Process ID that will hold a common field Process ID from the target process.   Click on the Bin/Trash button to delete a mapping. Click on the Add mapping button to add further mappings from the secondary/target process to the primary process. Ensure that form fields are already precreated to hold these values.    Further options exist under this section, starting with Trigger rules in target instance allowing you to kick off business rules enabling actions in the target process. Options are:\n  No where triggering rules is disabled, and no further options appear.\n  Yes where triggering rules is enabled, and further options appear:\n  Select a field or rule to trigger on target process - clicking on this field allows you to choose a form from the target process and from there you can drill down to a field to trigger all the rules attached to that field, or drill down to a particular rule so that only that rule will be triggered as shown in the example below.\nIf you want to save values passed under Input mapping then trigger the Save button (that contains the Save process and Close rules) found by default in all Kianda forms.\n  Enable real-time rule execution? - options are Yes or No. If you choose Yes, rules in the secondary/target process instance will trigger without any delay in the server. If you choose No then a second option becomes available to allow you to choose to Execute in series?\n Execute in series? - options are Yes or No. If you choose No then the server side execution of rules will happen in series or in sequence, instead of in parallel. In series or in sequence refers to synchronous execution, where a rule will only execute when the previous rule has completed. In parallel refers to asynchronous execution whereby rules execute without waiting for the previous rule to finish. This type of execution is useful when rules are not dependent on each other, for example the output of one rule is not used as input for another.        When you are finished editing the dialog box click on OK or click on Close at any time to exit the dialog box.\n  For more details on using On success mapping with other rules click on On success mapping.\nEditing, deleting or duplicating rules When you have clicked on an existing rule, and the rule is visible in the right-hand pane under Rules, there are a number of options available to you.\n  To disable a rule, click the slider across beside the rule name.\n  To copy a rule, click on the Duplicate button beside the rule name.\n  To delete a rule, click on the Bin/Trash button .\n  To view a rule, click on the rule name to open the Edit rule dialog box.\n  User tip   Remember the target process can be a Partner process and in this case, the partner organisation must have enabled process security (in the Process settings for the target process) to allow your process to interact with the target process. Use the Lookup existing process flag to find a particular instance of the target process at runtime. If you select Yes, then you can select a field in the current process which contains the id of the target instance. Use Trigger rules in target instance to select a field or rule to trigger in the target process. Set Execute in series to Yes to ensure server side execution is performed in series instead of in parallel. Another feature of this rule is that you can read data from another process instance. In this case it is advisable to give the title of the rule a title such as ‘Read data from Process X’. Click on the green bar of On success mapping and use this area to copy data from the target process to the current process.

For example, in a Training Request form, you may want the user to insert their first name and surname and may want those fields to be mandatory for the user to complete.\nThere are various options available when creating a Text box field, such as formatting it to allow multiple lines of text, to contain a password (text input is not shown) or to autofill with saved information such as the user’s address or email. More advanced options include applying a rule or expression to a Text box field - for more information, see Rules and Expression builder.\nHow to get started   To add a Text box field to a form, first open the relevant process.\n  Then select the form within that process that you want to add the field to (so that the Edit Form button is visible).\n  Click on Controls in the left-hand pane to expand the Controls menu.\n  Select Input to view the range of Input controls and click on Text box.\nA Text box field will be added to your form with the default title of ‘’Text box 1’’ and a pop-up message will say ‘Field added’.\nIn the example shown here, a Text box field has been added to a form called ‘Training Request’ in a process called ‘Training Process’, as the first step in adding two Text box fields (which will be used to capture the first name and surname of the user who is completing the form).\nYou can also place a Text box within an element - such as within a panel in a form. In the example above, the Text box was inserted outside the panel in the form. If you wanted to insert it within the panel, simply select the panel itself by clicking on its drag handle and then click on Controls \u003e Input \u003e Text box - this will result in the new Text box being added inside the panel, as shown here:\n  How to edit, move and delete Text box fields As we go through the options available for editing a Text box, we will keep in mind the example of adding two text boxes to the ‘Training Request’ form to capture a user’s first name and surname.\nHow to edit a Text box field To edit a Text box field:\n  Select the Text box (by either clicking on its title or its Drag handle button ).\n  Click on the Edit field button (Pen icon) .\nThe Edit field - Text box dialog box will open, enabling you to choose from a range of options:\n  Title - you can change the title of the Text box from the default ‘Text box 1’. In our example, we could change the name of the first Text box to ‘First Name’ and the second Text box to ‘Surname’.\n  Name - This is a unique name for the field and inherits a camel case version of the entered Title.\n  Help text - you can insert text to help the form user to complete the Table. If you add help text, a question mark icon will appear next to the field title and, if the user clicks on this, they will see the help text you have inserted.\n  Custom CSS class name - You can type the name of a CSS class to allow the Textbox to inherit specific styles defined in the Global CSS file.\n  Mode - you can decide whether your Text box is limited to a Single line of text or will allow for Multiple lines of text or can choose Rich text. Different additional options will then be shown, depending on the Mode you have chosen.\nIf you choose ‘Single line of text’ as the Mode for your Text box - as in the example shown above - these additional options will be shown:\n  Max length - choose the maximum number of characters for the text inserted in your Text box by either typing in a number or by clicking the up/down arrow buttons at the right side of the blank field beneath it\n  Text style - choose Normal, Capitalise, Uppercase or Lowercase, depending on how you want the text input in the Text box to appear\n  Control type - choose either Text or Password. If you choose Password, then the text input by the user in the Text box will not be visible:\n  Autofill type - you can choose between Default, Off, Password, Address, Email and Phone. If, for example, you select Address, this means that when the user is completing this Text box field, it will automatically populate with the user’s saved address information (if the user has that saved information on their PC or mobile phone).\n  Placeholder - you can insert placeholder text to appear in the Text box field to assist the user. For example, this Text box field titled ‘Address 1’ has placeholder text:\n  If you choose ‘Multiple lines of text’ as the Mode for your Text box, these additional options will be shown:\n  Rows - you can decide how many rows of text you want your Text box to have.

FTP is a standard communication protocol used for the transfer of computer files from one system to another over the internet.\nThe FTP data connector allows you to use an online file system as a data source for your Kianda forms or dashboards. This means that as your processes are running they will use the information from the online file system or depending on the process, update or delete information at in the online file system location. Kianda has the ability to extract files, navigate subfolders and write new files into the online directory. Any operation performed using the FTP data connector will directly change files within the online file system.\nWhen to use You can use the FTP connector when you want access or modify data or files within any folder in your FTP server. You can perform Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) operations on any files within the FTP server that you have access to.\nHow to get started   From the Kianda home page, click on Administration \u003e Data sources.\n  Click on + Add new button and choose FTP from the list of data sources provided.\n  You will be automatically brought to the FTP details page, where you can start setting up the connection.\nChoose from the edit options:\n  Display name - type in the name for your FTP connector.

When you are running a local server on your machine you can use your own IP address as the server.\n  FTP root folder - name of the root folder that is specified in your server. Note that the root folder that you specify here must be exactly the same as on the FTP server. For example If your root folder on the FTP server is /Files, you must also specify that the FTP root folder is /Files. It is possible to successfully connect the FTP connector if you specify a different FTP root folder than on the server but you will not be able to access the files properly.\n  FTP port - enter the port on which your server listens on.\n  Use SSL - check this box if your FTP server has SSL security.\n  FTP username - enter the username you use to connect to your FTP server.\n  FTP password - enter the password you use to connect to your FTP server.\n  Use Kianda Cloud Connect - by default this option is disabled, the cloud connect is used to create a connection between a locally run FTP server and Kianda itself. To learn more about Kianda Cloud Connect and how to create a connection between Kianda and your PC, go to Kianda Cloud Connect. Check this option if you want to connect to a server that is running on your local machine. When Use Kianda Cloud Connect is enabled, a Connectors option appears.\n  Connectors - displays all available connector PC’s that have a connection established with your Kianda subscription. This option is used to select the PC connection that runs the local FTP server that you want to connect to.\n      When you have added File system details, you are ready to test your connection and add security.

To learn how to create your first dashboard page, go to How to create a dashboard page.\nFor this example, we’ll open a dashboard page called ‘Annual Leave’ that currently has a Rich Text widget and List widget on it:\n  Click on the Edit current page button from the top dashboard menu to go into Dashboard Edit mode (in which the Widget menu, Settings button , Bin/Trash button and Add layout container button are available):\n  Click on the Link widget button in the Dashboard Widget menu.\n  The Add widget dialog box opens with a range of options for your new Link widget.\nChoose the options you want:\n  Title - You can insert the title you want for your Link widget. In our example, we’ll call it ‘Start New Process’.\n  Layout columns - You can choose how wide you want your Link widget to be. You can choose from 1 to 12 columns in width by clicking on the blue bar. For example click half-way across the blue bar to create a widget that is 6 columns wide, or click to the very end of the bar to create a column that is 12 columns wide.\n  Custom CSS - You can add a custom CSS class name to your link widget which you can use this to style the link. To learn more on adding CSS to your platform, visit Global CSS.\n  Colour scheme - You can choose from six colour options for the header of the widget (Navy, Green, Blue, Amber, Red or White), if you choose to display it.\n  Show header - You can choose whether or not you want the header of your Dashboard widget to be shown. You will need to select this checkbox if you want the Link widget header to be displayed, as it is not selected by default. If the widget header is not shown, the user will just see the link button.\n  Visible to - You can choose who will be able to see the Link widget. Select single or multiple Users or Groups, or a combination of the two. You can use the menu on the right to either filter the drop-down list by Users or Groups. To find out more about pre-defined Groups on Kianda, go to Users \u0026 Groups.\n  Note - Dashboard page security: When a dashboard page is first created, the users(s)/group(s) who will be able to view the dashboard are selected in the ‘Visible to’ option in the Create dashboard page dialog box (see Step 3 in How to create a Dashboard page).\nYou can also edit or update this setting at any point to change who has permission to view a particular dashboard page. This higher dashboard-level security setting will take precedence over the security settings (‘Visible to’) that are applied to the individual widgets within the dashboard (such as a Link widget, in this case).\nSee Dashboard security and Widget security for more information.\n    Device visibility - You can choose what devices and types of internet connections the dashboard Link widget will be visible on - select all the options you want from Desktop, Tablet, Mobile, Wi-Fi and Flight mode as to when the device can view the dashboards. By default, all options are selected.\n    Click on OK when you’ve completed the Add widget dialog box.\n  An Edit button links dialog box automatically opens showing the Link widget title you inserted in the Add widget dialog box:\nClick on the title of the Link widget or on the Edit link button to open the Edit link dialog box.\nNote: You can click on the Add link button to add more link buttons to the Link widget. You will be able to edit the options relating to each of these individual link buttons by clicking on their title or on their Edit link button.\n  Select the options you want for this link button in your Link widget in the Edit link dialog box.\nThe options available for your Link widget include:\n  Link text - You can insert the text you want to appear on your Link widget button.\n  New Process/ Dashboard/ External - You can select whether you want the Link widget to link to a new instance of an existing Kianda process, to an existing dashboard or to an external website.\n  If you select to link to a New Process:\n  Click on the down arrow in the Target process field to open a drop-down list of Kianda processes.\n  Select the Kianda process that you want to open when the user clicks on the Link widget. You can type the start of a process name into the field so the drop-down list is filtered to show processes starting with that letter or word.\nIn our example, we will select the ‘Annual leave request and approval process’ as the Target process for our new Link widget; this will mean that a new instance of the ‘Annual Leave request form’ will open when the user clicks on the ‘Start New Process’ Link widget button on the dashboard.\n  If you want the process to open in a pop-up dialog box without the user leaving the dashboard page, select the Show in dialog? checkbox. Otherwise, the user will be brought directly into the first form in the process that you have linked to.\n    If you select to link to a Dashboard, the option below it changes to Target dashboard’:\n  Click on the down arrow in the Target dashboard field to open a drop-down-list of Kianda processes.\n  Select the Kianda dashboard that you want to open when the user clicks on the link button.\n    If you select to link to an External website, two options display below it - URL and ‘Open in new window?’:\n Insert the URL you want the user to be brought to when they click on the Link widget. Select the ‘Open in new window?’ checkbox if you want the external website to open in a new window.      QueryString parameters - QueryString parameters can be added to the URL of the destination selected. You must define a process or dashboard as a destination to add a QueryString to the URL. To learn more about query strings, visit Query Strings.\n  Append Query - there are two ways the append query works, that depends whether it redirects you to a Process or a Dashboard. When redirecting to a process, you should always check this box as the query will not automatically append to your URL. When redirecting to a dashboard and the checkbox is checked, the query will append to the existing query string. But if the checkbox is unchecked, the query string will be overwritten. This is useful when working when passing query string parameters through multiple dashboards.\nAs an example, let’s say that when the user clicks on the link in the Link widget, you want the First Name field of the new Annual Leave Request form they are brought to to be pre-populated with the name ‘John’.To do this, insert the unique name of that field, as well as the value you want that field to be pre-populated with into the QueryString parameters box - in this case that will be ‘firstName=John’. [The grey text that appears in the QueryString parameters field when you open the dialog box - param1=value1 is just placeholder text.]\n  Note: The unique name of a field can be found by selecting the field in the form it is in and clicking on the Edit field button. The field’s unique name can then be copied from the Name (Unique) field.\nIn our example, the unique name of the ‘First Name’ field in the ‘Leave Request’ form is ‘firstName’:\n  For our query string parameter example to work, we now need to add an On load Set form field rule (that is, a rule that is executed when the form is opened that will run a query string to automatically populate a field in the form).\nTo do this, we go to Designer, and add a Set form field rule to execute when the form is loaded. In our example, the rule will set the ‘First Name’ field when the form is loaded:\nOnce the rule has been saved, it can be viewed in the On load rules section of the right side menu when the process is opened:\nTo learn more about the Set form field rule, go to Set form field rule or to learn more about Rules in general, see Rules.\n    Link icon - You can choose the icon you want to appear on your Link widget button. Click on the down arrow and select the icon you want to use from the large number of options available.\n  Text colour - You can choose the colour of the text that appears on the Link widget button. For example, if we choose orange, our Link widget button could look like this:\n  Link size - You can choose the width of the Link widget button, from 1 column wide to 12 columns wide. Change the width by clicking on the blue bar.\n  Link visible to administrators only? - Select Yes if you want to limit the visibility of this particular link button in the Link widget to Kianda Administrators only.\n  Link security (optional) - You can limit visibility of this link button - the ‘Start New Process’ link, in our example - in the Link widget by selecting the user(s) and/or group(s) you want to be able to see it on the dashboard.\nIf you choose ‘Yes’ to the ‘Link visible to administrators only’ option, you could then add in other users (in addition to administrators) who you want to be able to see the link button using this ‘Link security’ option.\nNote: If you have multiple button links in your Link widget, you can limit the users/groups who can view each of the link buttons within that Link widget.\n    Click on the OK button when you are finished choosing the options you want for your Link widget (or click on Close to exit the Edit link dialog box without saving).\n  Your Link widget will now be displayed on your dashboard. Click on Save in the dashboard top menu to save the insertion of the new widget.\n  How to edit Link Text widgets To edit a Link widget on a dashboard:\n  In the dashboard, click on the Edit current page button in the top menu to view the page in Dashboard Edit mode (in which the Widget menu, Settings button and Bin/Trash button are available).\n  Click on the Link widget’s Update configuration (Edit) button .\n  The Edit button links dialog box opens, enabling you to make whatever changes you want to the link button(s) in the Link widget using the same range of options as outlined in Step 6 of How to get started.\n  Making the changes you want and then click OK.\n  The updated Link widget will be shown on the Dashboard. Click on Save in the dashboard top menu to save the changes you’ve made.\n  How to move Link widgets To move a Link widget on a dashboard:\n On your dashboard, click on the Edit current page button in the top menu to go into Dashboard Edit mode. Select the widget’s drag handle button . Drag and drop the widget where you want it to go on your dashboard. Click on Save in the dashboard top menu to save the changes you’ve made.  In our example, we could move the new Link widget to the top left of the dashboard:\nHow to delete Link widgets To delete a Link widget from your dashboard:\n  On your dashboard, click on the Edit current page button in the top menu to go into Dashboard Edit mode.\n  Click on the widget’s Remove widget (Bin/Trash icon) button .\n  A Delete widget dialog box will open. Click on OK to delete the widget (or click on Cancel if you wish to cancel the deletion).\n  Click on Save in the dashboard top menu to save the changes you’ve made.\n  How to edit Link widget settings To update or edit your Link widget settings:\n  On your dashboard, click on the Edit current page button in the top menu to go into Dashboard Edit mode.\n  Click on the Update widget settings (Cog) button .\n  The Edit widget dialog box will open, enabling you to make changes to any of the available options (the same options as were available in the Add widget dialog box discussed in Step 4 of How to get started).\nIn our example, we could choose to reduce the width of the Link widget to be 4 columns wide, by clicking to the left of the existing blue bar.\n  Click on OK to confirm the changes you’ve made to the widget settings (or click on Close if you don’t want to retain any changes).\n  The updated Link widget will display on your dashboard. Click on Save in the dashboard top menu to save the changes you’ve made.\n  Saving changes Make sure to save any changes you make to your Link widget by clicking on the Save button in the dashboard top menu. If you leave the dashboard without saving the changes you have made to a widget, the next time you visit the dashboard it won’t include any of the changes made to it since the dashboard page was last saved.\nWhat’s next  Now that you’ve learned about the Dashboard Link widget, find out more about the other types of Dashboard widgets you can add to your Kianda dashboard:\n Chart widget Filter widget Rich Text widget List widget Tile widget Walkthrough widget Custom dashboard widget  ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"A dashboard Link widget can be used to create a button link on a …","ref":"/platform/pages/link/","tags":"","title":"Link widget"},{"body":"What is a PWA?

They can be used as either a toggle or as a checkbox - for example, Toggle fields could be used to create a series of checkboxes in an Onboarding Form to record whether a new employee has received required training, been assigned an employee number and so on.\nRules can be applied to Toggle fields to make your form more dynamic. One such rule, the Show, hide or disable rule can be applied to a Toggle field to have the effect of showing or hiding remaining options/sections in the form dependent on whether the toggle/checkbox is selected or not.\nFor example, in a Training Request form, a Toggle field could be used to record a manager’s decision to either approve or reject an employee’s training request - by applying the Show, hide or disable rule to this field, a different last section of the form will display based on the manager’s decision. If the manager select’s to approve the training, a sign-off button then appears; if the manager reject’s the request, a ‘Reason’ text box appears for them to insert their feedback. To learn more about applying rules to fields, see Rules and Expression builder. To find out more about this specific rule, go to Show, hide or disable.\nHow to get started   To add a Toggle field to a form, first open the relevant process.\n  Then select the form within that process that you want to add the field to (so that the Edit Form button is visible). If you want to add the Toggle field to a panel within your form, first select the panel by clicking on it and then add the Toggle field.\n  Insert the new Toggle field by clicking on Controls in the left-hand pane to expand the Controls menu, then select Input to view the range of Input controls and click on Toggle.\n  A New field - Toggle dialog box will open with a range of options you can choose from for your new Toggle field.\n   Title - You can change the name of the Toggle field from the default title Toggle 1.\n  Name - This is a unique name for the field and inherits a camel case version of the entered Title.\n  Help text - You can insert text to explain to the form user what selecting the toggle/checkbox means. If you add help text, a question mark icon will appear next to the field title and, if the user clicks on this, they will see the help text you have inserted. In this example, the Toggle field is titled ‘Approve Training’ and has associated help text:\n  Custom CSS class name - You can type the name of a CSS class to allow the Toggle to inherit specific styles defined in the Global CSS file.\n  Value when enabled - You can set the value for when the user selects the toggle/checkbox. For example, the value when it is selected could be ‘Yes’.\n  Value when disabled - You can set the value for when the user does not select the toggle/checkbox. For example, the value when it is not selected could be ‘No’.\n  Display mode - You can choose to have the Toggle field display as either a Toggle button or Checkbox .\n  Once you complete the New field - Toggle dialog box and click OK button, a new Toggle field is added to your form, with the name you inserted as the Title in the dialog box (by default, the title is Toggle 1 unless you change it).\n  If we take the example of the Training Request form we already discussed, with a Toggle field called ‘Approve Training Request’ that is formatted to be a checkbox, the Toggle field could look like this when a user views it on their mobile phone:\nTo check how your form or field will look like on a mobile, view it in Mobile preview by clicking the Preview button (play icon) after first saving your changes.\nHow to edit, move and delete Toggle fields As we go through the options available for editing a Toggle field, we will keep in mind the example of the ‘Approve Training Request’ Toggle field in our Training Request form.\nHow to edit a Toggle field To edit a Toggle field:\n  Select the field (by either clicking on the field title or on the field’s Drag handle button ).\n  Click on the Edit field button (Pen icon) .\nThe Edit field - Toggle dialog box will open, enabling you to choose from the same range of options as appear in the New field - Toggle dialog box (as already discussed in How to get started).\n  You can make any changes you wish in this dialog box and then click OK to confirm.\n  You can apply rules to a Toggle field to make it more dynamic so that, for example, it generates information that is automatically inserted into another field.\nFor example, you could apply a ‘Set date’ rule to your ‘’Order Received’ toggle field so that it generates a date to be displayed in a ‘Date received’ field when Order received is selected by the user - this will mean that when the user selects the Order Received toggle field, this automatically generates a date stamp for when the order was received:\nTo learn more about applying rules to fields, see Rules and Expression builder. To find out more about the specific rule added in our example - where a date is automatically populated in another field - go to Set form field.\nHow to move a Toggle field To move a Toggle field:\n Simply select the field’s Drag handle button . Drag and drop the field wherever you want to move it to within your form.

Version history management is introduced below.\nVersion history management Version history management is useful for troubleshooting but also during audits, to see specifically changes made and who executed those changes.\nYour Kianda workspace cleverly allows you to manage process design and process instance versioning so that administrators can see what has happened at specific moments during process execution and roll-back to earlier versions if needed.\nKianda Designer allows administrators or those with the design business process role, to update process designs. The platform keeps a record of all versions previously created. The current or active version of a process is always visible in the right-hand pane, for example V1.0 for the ‘Inspection Process’ as shown below.\nThe first version of a process is always 0.1 and each time the Save button is clicked, the version will increment to 0.2 and so on. Once the process is published the version changes to 1.0 and increments to 2.0 and so on with each publication.\nClicking on the Design version history button itself opens the Version history details dialog box.\nHere you can see when a process design was modified and by whom. Clicking on the version number itself releases details of changes made, for example forms, fields and rules that were added, modified or removed.\nAt any time an older version of the design can be reinstated by clicking on the Restore button beside a particular version.\nThis level of detail provides a precise way to monitor what is happening with a process design and to control which version should be the current version in an easy-to-use interface. The Version history page provides a step-by-step guide on how to view version history.\nWhen a process design has been published, and data captured using that design, then the Process instance version history provides a useful way to see how and when a process design has been used and who has captured data using that design.

To learn more about how you can set up and manage Groups, go to Users \u0026 Groups.\nFor example, in a ‘Training Request’ form, you may insert a User picker field titled ‘Manager’ so that the user can select their manager (who will subsequently need to approve or reject their training request once it has been submitted).\nHow to get started   To add a User picker field to a form, first open the relevant process.\n  Then select the form within that process that you want to add the field to (so that the Edit Form button is visible).\n  Click on Controls in the left-hand pane to expand the Controls menu.\n  Select Input to view the range of Input controls and click on User picker. If you want to insert the new field into a panel in your form, first select the panel by clicking on the drag handle button and then insert the new User picker field from the Controls menu.\n   A New field - User picker dialog box will open with a range of options you can choose from for your new User picker field.\n  Title - You can change the name of the User picker field from the default ‘’User picker 1’.\n  Name - This is a unique name for the field and inherits a camel case version of the entered Title.\n  Help text - You can insert text to help the form user to complete the User Picker field. Taking the example of the ‘Manager’ User picker field in a ‘Training Request’ form, you could insert help text to this effect:\nIf you add help text, a question mark icon will appear next to the field title and, if the user clicks on this, they will see the help text you have inserted.\n  Custom CSS class name - You can type the name of a CSS class to allow the User picker to inherit specific styles defined in the Global CSS file.\n  Selection Mode - You can choose whether the user will only be able to select one user from the User Picker list (by selecting Single) or whether the user will be able to select multiple users (by selecting Multiple).\nIf you choose to allow the user to select multiple users, by selecting Multiple as the Selection mode, an additional option then displays - Max users to select. Here you can set a maximum number of users that can be selected - you can do this by either manually typing the number into the box or by clicking on the up/down buttons at the right-hand side of the box.\n  Default to current user - You can choose to have the current user display in the User picker field once the form is opened to be edited. If you select ‘Yes’, so the User picker field shows the current user by default, an additional option then displays - Allow override picker value.\nIf you choose Yes for Allow override picker value, this automatically allows the override of the user in the User Picker field.\nFor example, in an ‘Annual Leave Request’ form, there could be an ‘Employee Name’ User picker field that defaults to the current user; but we may want the Employee’s Manager to be able to override the name in this field if they are submitting an annual leave request on behalf of an employee.\n  Member of group - You can choose to restrict the users available to be selected in the User picker field to a certain group - for example, only users in the HR Team. Alternatively, you can leave this field blank.\nWhen you click into the Member of group field, you will see a drop-down list of all of the Groups you can select:\nIn Kianda, Groups can be configured under the Administration menu - to learn more about how you can set up and manage Groups, go to Users \u0026 Groups.\nFor example, if you select ‘HR Team’, the end user completing the form will only be able to select users who are members of the ‘HR Team’ group in this User picker field.\n  Selection options - You can choose what selection options are available to the form user to the right of the User picker field. You can choose to show as many of these three selection options as like: Users (all users), Groups (such as HR) and Partners.\nFor example, if you choose to make all three selection options available, your User picker field will have a drop-down menu to the right where the form user can switch between Users, Groups and Partners:\nNote: If you have inserted a Group in the Member of group field, this selection will limit the users or groups available to be selected in the User picker field, regardless of what Selection options you choose to make available to the form user.\n  Default selection option - You can choose to have a certain selection option displayed to the right of the User picker field by default - either Users, Groups or Partners.\n  Show selection option menu - You can choose whether or not the selection option menu (where the form user can switch between Users, Groups and Partners) is shown on the right-hand side of the User picker field.\nIf you choose No, there will not be a selection option menu:\nIf you choose Yes, a selection option menu will be available to the form user to click (to change the list of users they can select from):\n  Once you complete the New field - User picker dialog box and click OK, a new User picker field is added to your form, with the name you inserted as the Title in the dialog box (by default the title is User picker 1 unless you change it).\nIn the example of our Training Request Form, the new User picker field (titled Manager) added to the form could look like this when a user views it on their mobile phone:\nTo see how your form or field will look on a mobile, view it in Mobile preview by using the Preview option which can be opened by clicking the play button icon . You also have the options to see how it will look on a PC or tablet.\n  How to edit, move and delete User picker fields As we go through the options available for editing a User picker field, we will keep in mind the example of the ‘Manager’ User picker field in the ‘Training Request’ form.\nHow to edit a User picker field To edit a User picker field:\n Select the field (by either clicking on the field title or on the field’s Drag handle button ). Click on the Edit field button (Pen icon) .  The Edit field - User picker dialog box will open, enabling you to choose from the same range of options as appear in the New field - User picker dialog box (as already discussed in How to get started).\nYou can make any changes you wish in this dialog box and then click OK to confirm.\nHow to move a User picker field To move a User picker field simply select the field’s Drag handle button and drag and drop the field wherever you want to move it to within your form.\nHow to delete a User picker field To delete a User picker field from your form:\n Select the field (by either clicking on the field’s title or its Drag handle button ). Click on the Bin/Trash button . Click on OK to confirm.  How to edit User picker field properties To view or edit the field properties associated with a User picker field, select the field (by clicking on the field title or field drag handle button ) - the Field properties menu will appear in the right-hand pane.\nFor example, the Field Properties associated with a User picker field titled ‘Manager’ are shown here and include:\n  Field type - The type of field, in this case a User picker field.\n  Title - The Title of the field, in this case ‘Manager’.\n  Show title - If this is selected, the User picker field title will be shown in the form.\n  Required - If this is selected, the User picker field will be a mandatory field that users must complete (denoted by a red asterix next to the field title).\n  Enabled - If this is selected, the user will be able to edit or interact with the field.\n  Visible - If this is selected, the User picker field will be visible in the form.\n  Layout - The width of the blue bar can be adjusted to change the width of the User picker field as it appears on a PC or mobile phone (to view the Mobile layout, click on the expand button to the right).\n  To learn more about the different options within the Field properties menu, go to Field Properties.\nSaving changes and version history Make sure to save any changes you make by clicking on the Save button . You will always have the option to revert back to previous versions of your form by clicking the Design Version History button in the top right corner.\nUser tips  Rules can be applied to User picker fields to make your form dynamic. Rules allow actions based upon conditions resulting from user interaction with fields. To learn about the different types of rules you can apply, go to Rules.\nFor example, you could apply a Set form field rule so that the User picker field is set to be the current user or the user who started the process off. The section below describes how to use a User picker field in forms with two rules in order to extract a value from a datasource.\nExample of User Picker use with Find Items and Lookup User rules The steps below detail how to use a User Picker field to pull a value from a datasource and use properties within the Kianda system associated with that value within a Kianda form to auto-populate a user picker field. This procedure is used when you need to populate more than one value in a user picker. Two rules are applied Find Items rule and Lookup user by property.\nFor example we start with a SharePoint list or other datasource that has a list of values, for example we could use a Kianda process as a datasource that holds values called ‘Employee number’ and ‘Employee’ in the system.\nIn the image above an Employee number or code is entered via a process for 3 system users, in this example the number ‘400’ represents 3 users, Bartosz, Caitriona and Cian. More records could be created with Employee numbers representing other employees or combinations of users.\nWe will use the values from the first process which acts as a datasource in a second process called ‘User Lookup’ where fields will be auto-populated based on the Employee No. value entered.\nFor example if ‘400’ is entered into this process, then the fields ‘Display names’ and ‘User picker 1’ are auto-filled. This is as a result of 2 rules on the Employee No. field the system property to display a value linked to these 3 users.\nWhat’s next  Now that you’ve learned about the User picker control, find out more about the other types of Input fields you can add to a Kianda process:\n Date control File upload control List control Number control Table control Text box control Toggle control  ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"The User picker field can be used in a form if you want the form user …","ref":"/platform/controls/input/user-picker/","tags":"","title":"User picker control"},{"body":"Introduction As an administrator you can test process designs using the Previewer and roll-back to earlier versions using the steps in Version history page. In addition to managing process design version history, as an administrator you can manage process instance history using the Process history feature. This will allow administrators to view when data has been saved for a particular record, who has saved the data and the changes made going from one version of the record to another.\nPrerequisites Before getting started, consider a particular process that requires investigation, using the name of the process design found in the Process designer page, for example Asset Request is a chosen process design as shown in the image below.\nThen check the records or instances of the process design by going to or creating a dashboard page and viewing a List widget that is linked to that process design. For example in the image below there are six process instances for the Asset Request design. We can investigate one of these in the steps below.\nProcess instance version history Process instances can be accessed from a list widget in a dashboard page linked to the process design. Access to the dashboard and list widget can be set using security settings, see Dashboard security.\nFor example by clicking on a process ID like ‘asset-request-3’ as seen in the list widget above, we can then see the actual record/process instance held in the system. In the Asset Request example below, all forms have had data submitted, including the last form in the process, the Order form.\nAdministrators have access to the process instance history feature highlighted above, to manage process instance versions. By clicking on the process history button, the Process history and Rule diagnostics view opens. Manage the history of the record/instance by following the steps below:\n  Click on the Process history tab.\n  View all versions of the process instance in the Process history view. Here you can see the number of the version, the date the version was created, who modified the version and you can restore to that version by clicking on the Restore button . To see the details of a version click on the hyperlinked Modified date.\n  Within the Version page you can see which forms and fields were modified/updated and which rules were executed.\nFor example in the version below, you can see system generated anonymous links such as that stored in in the field ‘Anonymous Order form Link’ which can be useful to retrieve and test.\nYou can also see changes in values, for example by default the Approval Status field in Kianda Designer is set to ‘False’, but when a user choose a Management Decision value of ‘Yes’, a Set form field rule will execute a rule to set a value in the field to ‘True’. This rule can be seen when the process design is viewed.\nA good knowledge of the process design as seen in Kianda Designer is necessary to support troubleshooting changes in process instances.\n  Click on the Back button or Close to return to the list of process instance versions.\n  What’s next  Now that you’ve learned about Version history and auditing, find out more about other troubleshooting features:\n Rule debugger Rule diagnostics Custom widget debugging  ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Introduction As an administrator you can test process designs using …","ref":"/troubleshooting/version-history-and-auditing/","tags":"","title":"Version history and auditing"},{"body":"A dashboard Walk-through widget can be used to walk a user through the features of a dashboard or steps in a process by displaying a series of prompts.\nFor example, if you have a Procurement dashboard page that displays key information relating to your procurement process (using Chart widgets, Tile widgets, a Link widget and a List widget), it could be useful to insert a Walk-through widget that can bring a new user through the various features of the page or through steps in the procurement process.\nHow to get started To add a Walk-through widget to a dashboard:\n  Open the relevant dashboard page. To learn how to create your first dashboard page, go to How to create a dashboard page.\nFor this example, we’ll open a dashboard page called ‘All Procurement’ that has several widgets on it displaying various information relating to a procurement process.\n  Click on the Edit current page button from the top dashboard menu to go into Dashboard Edit mode (in which the Widget menu, Settings button , Bin/Trash button and Add layout container button are available):\n  Click on the Walk-through widget button in the Dashboard Widget menu.\n  The Add widget dialog box opens with a range of options for your new Walk-through widget.\nChoose the options you want:\n  Title - You can insert the title you want for your Walk-through widget (instead of the default title shown). In our example, we’ll call it ‘Procurement Walk through’.\n  Layout columns - You can choose how wide you want your Walk-through widget to be. You can choose from 1 to 12 columns in width by clicking on the blue bar. For example click half-way across the blue bar to create a widget that is 6 columns wide, or click to the very end of the bar to create a column that is 12 columns wide.\n  Colour scheme - You can choose from six colour options for the header of the widget (Navy, Green, Blue, Amber, Red or White), if you choose to display it.\n  Show header - You can choose whether or not you want the header of your Dashboard widget to be shown. This checkbox is not selected by default, so select it if you want the widget header to be displayed.\n  Visible to - You can choose who will be able to see the Walk-through widget. You can select single or multiple Users or Groups, or a combination of the two. Use the menu on the right to filter the drop-down list by Users or Groups. To find out more about pre-defined Groups on Kianda, go to Users \u0026 Groups.\n  Note - Dashboard page security: When a dashboard page is first created, the users(s)/group(s) who will be able to view the dashboard are selected in the ‘Visible to’ option in the Create dashboard page dialog box (see Step 3 in How to create a Dashboard page).\nYou can also edit or update this setting at any point to change who has permission to view a particular dashboard page. This higher dashboard-level security setting will take precedence over the security settings (‘Visible to’) that are applied to the individual widgets within the dashboard (such as the Walk-through widget, in this case).\nSee Dashboard security and Widget security for more information.\n    Layout container: This option will only display if you have already created layout containers for your Dashboard page. Here, you can select the layout container you want to place your new Walk-through widget in.\nA layout container is a simple way to organise, arrange and move the widgets you add to your dashboard. To learn more about layout containers, go to How to add layout containers to a Dashboard page.\nIn this example, we can select to place our new Walk-through widget into one of three layout containers - Top, Middle or Bottom:\n  Device visibility - You can choose what devices and types of internet connections the dashboard Walk-through widget will be visible on - select all the options you want from Desktop, Tablet, Mobile, Wi-Fi and Flight mode as to when the device can view the dashboards. By default, all options are selected.\n    Click on OK when you’ve completed the Add widget dialog box.\n  A Walk-through steps dialog box automatically opens showing the options for the Walk-through widget:\nSelect the options you want for your Walk-through widget:\n  Title - You can give your Walk-through a title. In our example, we’ll call it ‘Procurement Walk-through’.\n  Walk-through steps - This is where you can add all of the individual walk-through steps that you want to bring the user through.\nTo add your first walk-through step:\n  Click on the Add step button.\n  The Edit step dialog box opens, allowing you to choose from a range of options for your walk-through step.\n  Once you’ve completed the options in the Edit step dialog box, click OK to add the step to the Walk-through steps dialog box.\nRepeat these three steps to add as many steps as you want to your Walk-through widget.\nThe options for the first step in your Walk-through widget in the Edit step dialog box include:\n    Title - Insert a title for this walk-through step. In our example, we’ll title our first step ‘Welcome step’.\n  Step type - You have a choice of three step types: Popup, App Navigation and Element click.\na. A Popup step is a pop-up dialog box containing whatever content you choose to display (including texts, links or pictures).\nb. An App Navigation step brings the user to a new URL - for example, it could bring them into the first form of a process.\nc. An Element click step shows the result of clicking on one of the elements in the dashboard.\nPopup Steps If you choose Popup as the step type, you can then complete the Popup content box to insert the content you want to appear in the pop-up walk-through step, including text, images or links.\nYou can choose from an wide array of styles and formats, including: Style, Colour, Bold, Underline, Remove font style, Font size, Font family, Unordered list, Ordered list, Paragraph, Table, Link, Picture, Code view (which allows you to switch to a code view of the step content) and Help (which displays a range of shortcut keys for different formatting options).\nIn our example, we will make the first step of our walk-through a Popup and will insert the content we want to appear:\nExample - Pop-up step This first Popup walk-through step could look like this to the end user when they click on the Procurement Walk-through widget:\nThe Element selector field at the bottom of the Edit step dialog box can be used if you want an element on the page to be highlighted, to show the user where they need to click.\nWe could add a second step in our walk-through to be another pop-up that explains that the user should click the ‘New Procurement Process’ button to start a new procurement process. This time we can add an Element selector so that the button is highlighted during this step.\nHow to find the name of an element to insert   Right-click on the element on the page that you want to higlight.\nIn our case, we right-click on the New Procurement Process link button on the dashboard (as this is what we want to highlight during this step of the walk-through).\n  Click Inspect.\n  Copy the element you want to be highlighted in this walk-through step. In our case, we copy the element relating to the New Procurement Process link button:\n  Paste the name of the element into the Element selector box in the Edit step dialog box. You can choose the position of the pop-up text in relation to the element being highlighted from the Position drop-down menu.\nExample - Element Selector This Popup step that includes an Element selector could look like this to the end user as the second step in the walk-through:\n  App Navigation steps If you choose App Navigation as the step type, complete the Destination URL field that appears.\nIn our example, we will make the third step of our walk-through an App Navigation step type and will title it ‘Go to Procurement form’. The URL inserted as the Destination URL will bring the user into the first form of the Procurement process.\nExample - App Navigation This third App Navigation step in our walk-through example could look like this to the end user - the user is brought to the website we insered as the ‘Destination URL’:\nElement click steps If you choose Element click as the step type, complete the Element selector field that appears - see How to find the name of an element to insert to find out how to find the code to insert in order to show different clickable elements of the dashboard or process.\n    Auto-start - Select Yes if you want the Walk-through widget to automatically launch when a user opens the dashboard page.\n  On tour end return to starting page - Select Yes if you want the user to be returned to the dashboard page once the Walk-through steps have been completed.\nYou can delete any of the walk-through steps you added to the Walkthrough steps dialog box by simply clicking on the Bin/Trash button to the right of the step.\n    Once you have completed the Walk-through steps dialog box - by choosing the options and adding the steps you want - click on OK (or click on Close to exit the dialog box without saving).\nThe completed Walk-through steps dialog box for our simplified example could look like this:\n  Click on the Save button in the top dashboard menu to save the insertion of the new Walk-through widget to the dashboard.\n  Your new Walk-through widget will now be shown on your dashboard.\n Our ‘Procurement walk-through widget could look like this on our All Procurement dashboard:    How to edit Walk-through widgets To edit a Walk-through widget on a dashboard:\n  In the dashboard, click on the Edit current page button in the top menu to view the page in Dashboard Edit mode (in which the Widget menu, Settings button , Bin/Trash button and Add layout container button are available).\n  Click on the Walk-through widget’s Update configuration (Edit) button .\n  The Walk-through steps dialog box opens, enabling you to make whatever changes you want to the Walk-through widget using the same range of options as outlined in Step 6 of How to get started but also showing the walk-through steps you created.\n  Making the changes you want and then click OK.\n  The updated Walk-through widget will be shown on the Dashboard. Click on Save in the dashboard top menu to save the changes you’ve made.\n  How to move Walk-through widgets To move a Walk-through widget on a dashboard:\n On your dashboard, click on the Edit current page button in the top menu to go into Dashboard Edit mode. Select the widget’s drag handle button . Drag and drop the widget where you want it to go on your dashboard. Click on Save in the dashboard top menu to save the changes you’ve made.  In our example, we could move the new ‘Procurement Walk-through widget to the top right section of the dashboard:\nHow to delete Walk-through widgets To delete a Walk-through widget from your dashboard:\n  On your dashboard, click on the Edit current page button in the top menu to go into Dashboard Edit mode.\n  Click on the widget’s Remove widget (Bin/Trash icon) button .\n  A Delete widget dialog box will open. Click on OK to delete the widget (or click on Cancel if you wish to cancel the deletion).\n  Click on Save in the dashboard top menu to save the changes you’ve made.\n  How to edit Walk-through widget settings To update or edit your Walk-through widget settings:\n  On your dashboard, click on the Edit current page button in the top menu to go into Dashboard Edit mode.\n  Click on the Update widget settings (Cog) button .\n  The Edit widget dialog box will open, enabling you to make changes to any of the available options (the same options as were available in the Add widget dialog box discussed in Step 4 of How to get started).\nIn our example, we could change the width of the Walk-through widget to be 6 columns wide (the same width as the tiles beside and below it on the dashboard), by clicking on the blue bar.\n  Click on OK to confirm the changes you’ve made to the widget settings (or click on Close if you don’t want to retain any changes).\n  The updated Walk-through widget will display on your dashboard. Click on Save in the dashboard top menu to save the changes you’ve made.\n  Saving changes Make sure to save any changes you make to your Walk-through widget by clicking on the Save button in the dashboard top menu. If you leave the dashboard without saving the changes you have made to a widget, the next time you visit the dashboard it won’t include any of the changes made to it since the dashboard page was last saved.\nWhat’s next  Now that you’ve learned about the Dashboard Walk-through widget, find out more about the other types of Dashboard widgets you can add to your Kianda dashboard:\n Chart widget Filter widget Link widget Rich Text widget List widget Tile widget  ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"A dashboard Walk-through widget can be used to walk a user through the …","ref":"/platform/pages/walkthrough/","tags":"","title":"Walk-through widget"},{"body":"Kianda AI rules is one category of rules in Kianda that is used to analyse text within fields of your process, for example analysing a feedback text box of a process.\nAI (Artificial Intelligence) is a form of intelligence demonstrated by machines, opposed to natural intelligence displayed by humans or animals.

Click on Save in the dashboard top menu to save the changes you’ve made.\n  How to move Custom dashboard widgets To move a Custom widget on a dashboard page:\n  On your dashboard, click on the Edit current page button in the top menu to go into Dashboard Edit mode.\n  Select the Custom dashboard widget’s drag handle button .\n  Drag and drop the widget where you want it to go on your dashboard.\n  How to delete Custom dashboard widgets To delete a Custom dashboard widget from your dashboard:\n  On your dashboard, click on the Edit current page button in the top menu to go into Dashboards Edit mode.\n  Click on the widget’s Remove widget (Bin/Trash icon) button .\n  A Delete widget dialog box will open. Click on OK to delete the widget (or click on Cancel if you wish to cancel the deletion).\n  How to edit Custom dashboard widget settings To update or edit your Custom dashboard widget settings:\n  On your dashboard, click on the Edit current page button in the top menu to go into Dashboards Edit mode.\n  Click on the Update widget settings (Cog) button .\n  The Edit widget dialog box will open, enabling you to make changes to any of the available options (the same options as were available in the Add widget dialog box discussed in Step 4 of How to get started).\nIn our example, we could choose to reduce the width of the Custom dashboard widget to be 4 columns wide, by clicking to the left of the existing blue bar.\n  Click on OK to confirm the changes you’ve made to the widget settings (or click on Close if you don’t want to retain any changes).\n  The updated Custom dashboard widget will display on your dashboard. Click on Save in the dashboard top menu to save the changes you’ve made.\n  Saving changes Make sure to save any changes you make to your Custom dashboard widget by clicking on the Save button in the dashboard top menu. If you leave the dashboard without saving the changes you have made to a widget, the next time you visit the dashboard it won’t include any of the changes made to it since the dashboard page was last saved.\nWhat’s next  Now that you’ve learned about Custom dashboard widgets, find out more about the other types of Dashboard widgets you can add to your Kianda dashboard:\n Chart widget Filter widget Rich Text widget Link widget List widget Tile widget Walkthrough widget Custom dashboard widget  ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"There are currently seven pre-defined dashboard widgets that you can …","ref":"/platform/pages/custom/","tags":"","title":"Custom dashboard widgets"},{"body":"Document generation refers to the use of Kianda Add-ins for Word, and also Excel, that you can use to generate reports within Kianda processes and populate the reports with data captured within each process instance. This could be useful, for example, for inspection reports where a report template can be used to show the information the engineer input to a Kianda form during his inspection. Each time an inspection is performed, a report is generated based on a Word template and the report shows the relevant information that was captured during that particular inspection.\nMicrosoft Word template with Kianda form fields\nIn the example above, a report will generate data pulled from a Kianda process instance (record) that contains the date, company and location data within an ‘Inspection Form’ and a ‘Request Form’. To create this kind of template, you can use a Kianda Add-in in Word to link your document to your Kianda process.\nInstalling Kianda Add-in to Word or Excel The example below steps through how to install the Kianda Add-in for Word, however the same steps apply to get started with the Kianda Add-in for Excel.\n  Create a template outline in Microsoft Word.\n  Click on the Insert tab \u003e Get Add-ins\n  Search for Kianda.\n  Click on Add, then Continue and click on the Home tab. The Show Kianda Taskpane should be added to your ribbon.\n  On the right-hand side of the Home tab, click on the Kianda Add-in.\n  In the Kianda pane log in using your Kianda username and password.\n  From the drop-down list under Login to Kianda, select your Kianda subscription and press Continue. Note that all of your subscriptions will be available in the drop-down. Make sure to select the correct one when creating you template.\n  Before you begin using the Kianda add-in for Word or Excel When you want to use Kianda add-in for both a Word or Excel template, you need to have created a process with one or more forms. The forms need to have different types of fields within them, for example a text box field or a table field. Those fields are used to create smart tags using the Kianda add-in within a Word or Excel template. Smart tags are created when a field is selected from a process using the Kianda add-in task pane, and then inserted into the document. See the image below for a presentation of a smart tag in Excel:\nBefore you get started, you also need to have the outline of a template ready so that you can import data from your process by using the smart tags. For each instance of a process the smart tags will pull values from that a specific process instance, but the outline of the template will stay the same. For example, if you create a Health \u0026 Safety checklist process, the outline of the checklist is always the same but the values may differ for each time the checklist is filled out. A template outline represents the generic outline of what data will be needed in the final generated document, for example, you need the date, the company, location and relevant checks that need to be performed. See image below for an example of a template outline:\n We have briefly introduced the concept of document generation in Kianda.

Google Drive is a personal cloud based file system with many subscriptions including team subscriptions. This allows you to store files online and share them with your team or use it as a backup. This means that as your processes are running they will use the information from the cloud file system or depending on the process, update or delete information at the Google Drive cloud file system.\nWhen to use You can use the Google Drive connector when you want a process within your Kianda subscription to have access to your Google Drive cloud file directory. You can extract files from Google Drive into Kianda by using a List field control. Set the datasource of the List field to be your Google Drive connector allowing you to access files from you Google Drive account, to learn more about the List field go to List control. You can also use the Google Drive data connector within the Data set of rules, these rules allow you to perform Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) operations. To learn more about the Data rules, go to Data rules.\nBefore getting started In advance of using the Google Drive data connector, you must have an account with Google. The account is used to authorise a connection between your Kianda subscription and your Google Drive account.\nHow to get started   From the Kianda home page, click on Administration \u003e Data sources.\n  Click on + Add new button and choose Google Drive from the list of data sources provided.\n  You will be automatically brought to the Google Drive data connector page, where you can start setting up the connection.\nChoose from the edit options:\n Display name - type in the name for your Google Drive connector. The display name is used to identify your connector.    Click on the Authorize button.\n  A Google Drive authentication window will open. Select the account you want to use when authenticating the connection.\n  Google Drives security will block the access to Kianda when trying to authenticate and you will be presented with similar window as shown below. In the window, click on Advanced.\n  In the advanced options, click on Go to kianda.com(unsafe).\n  This will now bring you to a web page in which you will be able to allow the connection. Click on Allow.\n  When you have successfully authenticated your Google Drive account, the system will test your connection automatically. If that has not been done, at the bottom of the Google Drive details page, click on Test connection button and you should receive a notification saying Connection test succeeded.\n  Click on Save to save the connection and you will receive a notification saying Details saved successfully.\n  Add Security settings by clicking on the Security button, go to Setting security for data sources for more details.\n  Click on Close to close the details page and return to the data source management main view.\n  Google Drive parameters When you use the Google Drive datasource, there are default parameters invoked from the files that you can access. For example when you create a list filed in a Kianda form and use Google Drive as its datasource, these Google Drive parameters will appear in Display field, Value field and Sort by field in the Edit field dialog box, see Name for example in the image below:\nThe Google Drive parameters that appear in those three dropdown fields are:\n Name - name of the file including the extension. NameNoExtension - name of the file without the extension. Path - displays the full path to the file. Extension - displays just the extension of the file. Modified - displays the date and time when the file was last modified. Created - displays the date and time when the file was created. ParentFolderName - name of the folder that contains the file. ParentFolderPath - path of the folder that contains the file.  What’s next  Your Dropbox connector is now set up and ready to be used in your processes.

These rules are using SharePoint Application Programming Interface (API) to perform Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) operations within your SharePoint connector. The SharePoint rules are designed to manage your SharePoint connector instead of populating it with data. With these rules you can create a site, a list or a group on your SharePoint connector along with adding users to groups, removing them from groups or changing user or group permissions.\nTake an example of a Find a user rule. Implementing this rule will result in acquiring a Username or User Id of a particular user which is part of your SharePoint users group. When using SharePoint rules that are managing users, the Find a user rule is very useful as rules such as Add user to a group or remove user from a group require a User Id that can be retrieved from the Find a user rule.\nBefore getting started In advance of using the SharePoint rules you must have created a SharePoint data connector and establish a connection with your SharePoint site. The data connector is used as part of the SharePoint rules to perform CRUD operations on a site you established a connection with. To learn more about the SharePoint data connector go to SharePoint connector.\nGetting started with SharePoint rules If you go to Administration \u003e Designer and click on a process or create a new process, then click on Add a rule, the SharePoint rules are found in the left-hand pane when you click on SharePoint.\nThere are 10 SharePoint rules as follows:\n Create a list - creates a new list in a SharePoint site. Create a site - creates a new site on SharePoint, enabling the use of a site template. Create a group - creates a new group on SharePoint Find a user - finds or searches for a user within SharePoint Add a user to a group - adds a SharePoint user to a SharePoint group. It is important to note the difference between SharePoint users and Kianda users. SharePoint users are users of the SharePoint system. Kianda users are users of the Kianda system. Remove a user from a group - removes a SharePoint user from a SharePoint group Reset an item permissions - changes the SharePoint permissions for a given list, document or folder. Check in / out an item - checks in or out a file in SharePoint Get attachments - reads the attachments from a SharePoint list Create anonymous link - creates anonymous links for a SharePoint held file  What’s next  We have briefly introduced each of the ten types of SharePoint rules.

This table needs to be pre-created before adding this rule. If no table is selected in this field, an error message will show. When the Table to update is assigned, three more options are presented:\n  Table lookup conditions - allows you to add a condition that works like a filter. Adding a condition will allow you to target the specific row that the condition specifies. For example checking if a currency column is equal to Euro, the condition will look as follows:\nBox 1 represents the column from a row which you are looking up.\nBox 2 represents the value you are making the check against.\n  Table column to update - allows you to select a column you want to update when a condition in the Table lookup conditions option is met. This field will be updated with the value given in Field or text to update table column with section.\n  Field or text to update table column with - you can select a field within your form or type in text manually to represent the value you want your updated column to contain.\n    When you are finished editing the dialog box, click on OK or click on Close at any time to exit the dialog box.\n  Editing, deleting or duplicating rules When you have clicked on an existing rule, and the rule is visible in the right-hand pane under Rules, there are a number of options available to you.\n To disable a rule click the slider across beside the rule name.

This lightweight service will sit on your PC or server where files reside that you need to use in processes. It allows the data to travel from your local machine to the Kianda Cloud Connect service, and then the Kianda Cloud Connect service sends data to your subscription. This data transfer works both ways depending on what operation you are performing for example Deleting a file or Creating one.\nKianda Cloud Connect authenticates with a user created in Kianda, see User management for more details on users, and sends information to and from Kianda using port 443. See details below on how to set up the connection.\nDownloading Kianda Cloud Connect You can download Kianda Cloud Connect software in any details page of data source that might use it, for example in a File system data connector:\n  From the Kianda home page, click on Administration \u003e Data sources.\n  Click on + Add new button and choose File system from the list of data sources provided.\n  You will be automatically brought to the File system details page, where you can click on Download Kianda Cloud Connect at the bottom of the screen.\n  Clicking on Download Kianda Cloud Connect will automatically download a zipped folder. Extract the contents of the folder and open the Kianda Cloud Connect Windows Installer Package. You will need administrative privileges on your device in order to install the application.\n  Click on the Windows Installer Package CloudConnect.msi file.\n  Security on the device may prevent you from installing the app. If the below window appears click on the More Info link and then click Run Anyway.\n  In the Welcome to Kianda Cloud Connect Setup Wizard, follow the installation wizard to install the application. Click Next.\n  In the Select Installation Folder window, pick a folder where you want to install the software. Click Next.\n  In the Confirm Installation window, click Next.\n  Click on Yes in the administrator dialog box to give Kianda Cloud Connect access to your PC.\n  In the Installation Complete window click on Close. Once installed the application will be available on your desktop as an app.\n  Double-click the icon to open the application, then follow the steps below to connect your PC to Kianda Cloud Connect.\n  Connecting your PC to Kianda Cloud Connect To establish a connection between your Kianda subscription and your local machine, you need to login using a Kianda username (email) and password. Note that the user you are trying to establish a connection with must be an administrator and needs to be a unique username (email). The username you want to establish the connection with cannot be used in more than one Kianda subscriptions as Kianda Cloud Connect will not be able to tell which subscription you want to connect to.\nTo open Kianda Cloud Connect on your PC, open the Kianda Cloud Connect app installed on your PC, and the dialog box below will open. Note the version of Cloud Connect is visible in this dialog box, in this example 2.11.5.\n  To establish a connection fill out the following:\n Machine Identity - automatically sets the identity using the name of your local PC or server that the application has been installed on. This field is an un-editable value that cannot be changed. Kianda Username - type in the username/email of the user from your Kianda subscription you want to establish a connection with. This username must be unique across all Kianda subscriptions and must be an administrator. For example you cannot establish a connection with a connector@domain.com if this email is used in more than one subscription, as Kianda Cloud Connect will not be able to determine which subscription to make a connection with. For more information on users go to Users and groups. Kianda Password - type in the password used to login, for the user in the Kianda Username field. Status - the colour shown denotes if the connection is active, as a green colour, or inactive as a red colour. Enable Local Server - this allows Kianda to pass through the current server and connect to a local server or offline server/PC. Click the checkbox to enable this, followed by the ellipsis button to continue. Then add in the Local URL and click on OK.    Once the username and password have been entered, click on the Login button to establish a connection. It is recommended to have a specific user account that is used solely for the purpose of connecting the data connector to the Kianda subscription.\n  If the connection succeeded, in the Cloud Connection dialog box, click OK to complete the connection. Once the connection has been made the log in the dialog box will be populated with messages confirming the login has occurred. A dialog box will open confirming that the connection has been successfully established. When the connection has been established successfully, Kianda Cloud Connect will automatically connect to your subscription when the PC is turned on therefore you do not need to login when the PC is turned on.\n  Click on Clear to clear the connection log in the body of the dialog box.\n  All established connections will be visible in the Kianda Cloud Connect Connector section in any of the datasource connectors that use it, for example File system or SQL Server.\n  The connector is now established and can be used when designing processes.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Kianda Cloud Connect is a piece of software that establishes a …","ref":"/platform/connectors/data-gateway/","tags":"","title":"Data gateway"},{"body":" Release Notes March 2023\nMinor release 2.11.10\n V2.11.10 Bug Fixes    Description      Connectors can be created without a title    Fixed filtering issues on designer and developer    Update email token message recover password    Filtering issues fixed for isProc datasources    Groups can be created without trailing space    Renames form on import if exists in destination    SharePoint UTC issue    Widgets can be created with special characters    Rule schedule is losing the ID of its targeted rule when imported    Exporting list widget to OData sources results in 00:00:00 for created property    Caching datasource lists connected to Kianda process data    Boxing/Unboxing Fix and Async issue Fix     New Features     Description     1 Navigating away from design with changes - If you click on the Exit button to go back to the process list without clicking on the Save button you will be prompted with a dialog box detecting Unsaved changes prompting you to Abandon changes if desired.

It provides an insight into the logical flow of a process and serves as an important troubleshooting feature if your process does not work as expected. As well as this, it states what rule is being executed and on what field it is acting upon, alongside any associated conditions.\nThe Rule Debugger can be turned on at any point, for example when starting a new process or using the Previewer. We look at the Previewer in the steps below, however you can also access this feature via Rule diagnostics.\nPrerequisites Before getting started, you must open a process design of your choice that features rules that require debugging.\nHow to get started To access the rule debugger feature:\n  Navigate to the left-hand pane of the designer screen and click on the Run and preview process button .\n  In the preview window, click on the Enable / Disable Rule debugging button in the top right corner of the window.\n  Begin entering data into your process as expected until the rule debugger modal dialog appears in the bottom right of the preview window. This appears as soon as the first rule is encountered in the design’s logical workflow.\nThe rule debugger dialog displays information such as the Rule currently being executed, any Conditions associated with the rule and the Field the rule is being enacted upon. Three buttons are also displayed, allowing you to:\n Execute rule - executes the currently displayed rule on the currently displayed field, along with any conditions specified where you have two or more rules attached to a field, form or process. Once all the rules are executed for that field, then the dialog box will disappear and the system awaits further data input into the form’s fields until the next rule or block of rules attached to a field are met. Resume - resumes the execution of all rules in a block where there are two or more rules attached to a field, form or process. The rule debug dialog will only then reappear when new data is entered into another field in the process flow. Stop debug - exits the debugging mode and the rule debug dialog box disappears. You will not receive messages about current rule execution, but will remain in the process preview window.    You can alter the conditions on the currently displayed rule (if any), by clicking on the Conditions filter button . This will display another modal dialog box, which gives you the option to change the condition being applied to the rule, add further conditions, remove some conditions and more - allowing for the troubleshooting of different use cases within your process. To learn more about this, see Conditions.\n  To exit the debugging process, you can click on the Stop debug button , or alternatively click on the Enable / Disable Rule debugging button , or click on the Exit preview mode button .\nWhat’s next  Now that you’ve learned about the Rule debugger, find out more about other troubleshooting features:\n Custom widget debugging Rule diagnostics Version history and Auditing  ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Introduction The Rule debugger is a troubleshooting feature that …","ref":"/troubleshooting/rule-debugger/","tags":"","title":"Rule debugger"},{"body":"Introduction The Sort table rule loops through a table allowing you to sort data in an ascending or descending manner. In the rule options, you can select which column of the table to sort by. The column you select can be any of the Control input fields, the sorting algorithm takes the numerical or text value of each field and sorts it accordingly. For example if there is a User picker column in the table like shown below:\nThe sorting algorithm will use the text value or in this case the name of each user and sort it in an alphabetical order as the order is set to ascending. Take note that the Favorite Image column has also changes the order to the matching user as the sorting rule targets the whole row, not just the column. The result of the sort is as follows:\nWhen to use You can use this rule when you want to sort a table in an ascending or descending manner. The rule allows you to select the column by which you want to sort it, a field which identifies that column will make your table dynamic and very versatile.

MySQL is a relational database management system (RDBMS) used to manage structured collections of data. This data can consist of anything from a simple to do list to a more complex organisation network. Using the MySQL server as your datasource, you can perform any Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) operations using the Data rules provided in the Kianda platform, to learn more about data rules go to Data rules. Using the MySQL server connector, you have access to all tables within your database from your server, keep in mind that you can perform CRUD operations on data within a table of the database, but you cannot create or delete tables themselves.\nWhen to use You can use the MySQL Server connector when you want access or modify data within a table in your MySQL server. You can connect the MySQL server connector to a List field as its datasource, meaning you can access information from a table and display the information that is stored in the table. For example if your MySQL server contains tables such as Employees, Purchases and Standing Orders, you will be able to connect the list field to one of those tables giving you CRUD access to its data.\nTake a table Employees as an example, if this employee table contains data about the employees in your company such as name, phone number, email address and home address. You can create a new employee by providing necessary information, you can read (display) employee data, update employees information for example when a home address has changed and you can delete an employee from the table. Those are the CRUD operations you can perform on MySQL server through a process within Kianda.\nBefore getting started When establishing a connection using MySQL data connector, you are creating a connection with a Database from a server, not the server itself. Before continuing make sure that your MySQL server has a database you can connect to. A database can represent any type of data you want to access, and within this database, you need to create a table representing the actual data you will have CRUD access to. For example creating a database of your company name such as GreenITR, and within this database you can create tables to represent your Employees, Purchases and Standing Orders.\nHow to get started   From the Kianda home page, click on Administration \u003e Data sources.\n  Click on + Add new button and choose MySQL from the list of datasources provided.\n  Fill out fields in the MySQL Server details screen.\nChoose from the edit options:\n Display name - type in the name for your MySQL server connector. This is used to distinguish between different data connectors on your platform. Server - the name of the server you want to access or the IP address where the server is hosted. When you are running a local server on your machine you can use localhost as the server name. If you are connecting to a public server, enter in the name of the server. Database - the name of the database from your server that you want to connect to. User - username used to log into the server. Password - password used to log into the server. Use Kianda Cloud Connect - by default this option is disabled, the cloud connect is used to create a connection between a locally run MySQL server and Kianda itself. To learn more about Kianda Cloud Connect and how to create a connection between Kianda and your PC, go to Kianda Cloud Connect. Check this option if you want to connect to a server that is running on your local machine. When Use Kianda Cloud Connect is enabled, a Connectors option appears.  Connectors - displays all available connector PC’s that have a connection established with your Kianda subscription. This option is used to select the PC connection that runs the local MySQL server that you want to connect to.   Status - represents the current status of the connection.  incomplete - means that the details of the connector were not fully completed test failed - means that the details of the connector are incorrect and the connection has failed. ready - means that the connector has successfully connected and its ready to be used.      When you have added the MySQL server details, you are ready to test your connection and add security. At the bottom of the MySQL Server details page, click on Test connection button and if the service has been correctly configured, then you should receive a notification saying Connection test succeeded.\n  Click on Save to save the connection and you will receive a notification saying Details saved successfully.\n  Add Security settings by clicking on the Security button, go to Setting security for data sources for more details.\n  Click on Close to close the details page and return to the data source management main view.\n  What’s next  Your MySQL Server connector is now set up and ready to be used in your processes.

This will open the Process history modal dialog box.\n  On the process history dialog, navigate to the Rule diagnostics tab. From here, you can view a nested list of all forms, fields and rules. In the example below, you can view rules and fields across three different forms in the process, as well as expand the onload rules. You can search for a specific element in your process by utilising the search bar.\n  There are many possibilities for testing your process instance, however in this example we will try to troubleshoot the Send email rule to ensure that the line manager receives the correctly formatted email during this process.\nTo do this, we will drill down into the following path: Asset request form \u003e Submit button \u003e Rules \u003e Email Line Manager.\n  Beside the Email Line Manager rule, click on the orange Trigger bolt button to manually trigger the rule. This is a powerful feature as you do not need to fill out an entire process from start to finish to troubleshoot this. You will then see a Rule executed alert at the top of the page, and the specific rule should perform as expected.\n  There are other features you can troubleshoot in the Rule diagnostics tab such as clicking:\n Toggle form visibility button - to hide or show the selected form Make editable button - make the current field/form editable Re-assign form button - to assign the form to a different person Go to form button - snaps to the selected form Toggle field enable button - to enable/disable the selected field  As well as this, the Rule executed status can be seen beside each rule - a green tick for executed, and a grey tick for not executed.\n  To change the current form in your process instance, you can click on the Change current active form button below the form list. This will allow you to troubleshoot different forms and how they behave when changed to the active form in the process.\n  You can also choose to Enable rule debugging by choosing the Yes radio button, also below the nested list. This will enable the Rule debugger feature, however instead of executing within a process design preview window, it will enact upon your selected process instance.

Rather than constantly polling Kianda for updates, webhooks allow you to react immediately whenever process instances are created, updated, or deleted. This makes event handling efficient and responsive.\nWhen a webhook event fires, Kianda sends an HTTP GET request to the configured URL(s), passing along essential details such as the process name, instance ID, and the type of event. Your external application can then use this information to update its own records, trigger workflows, or perform any other actions needed.\nNote: The callback request has a timeout of 10 seconds. If your external service does not respond within this time, the request may fail.\nSetting Up Webhooks in Kianda To implement webhooks, you need an Administrator or Developer role. For more details on roles, see Users \u0026 Groups.\n  Open the Developer Resources:\n Go to Administration in the left-hand sidebar. Click on Developer to open the Developer resources page.

To produce its UI, Ember uses Handlebars, a templating language that makes it easy to bind data models to your HTML.\nIf you’re familiar with modern web development, you’ll find Ember’s approach intuitive: templates, components, and data binding come together to create a smooth, dynamic user experience within Kianda’s low-code environment.\nHandlebars: Templating Made Easy Handlebars is a templating language that lets you write declarative HTML with embedded expressions. These expressions—enclosed in {{double curly braces}}—are automatically replaced by values from your data models.\nFor example:\n\u003cp\u003e{{firstname}}{{surname}}\u003c/p\u003e If the data model provides:\n{  firstname: \"Ryan\",  surname: \"B'Oul\" } The rendered HTML is:\n\u003cp\u003eRyan B'Oul\u003c/p\u003e This simple approach makes it easy to display dynamic data without writing complex logic. When data updates, the template refreshes automatically, ensuring users always see the latest state.\nUsing Properties and Dot Notation Handlebars supports “dot notation” to access nested properties in objects:\n\u003cp\u003e{{person.firstname}}{{person.surname}}\u003c/p\u003e If person is an object with firstname and surname properties, Handlebars will replace them in the template, keeping your markup clean and readable.\nBuilt-in Helpers Ember and Handlebars include helpers—functions used inside templates to handle common tasks. For example, each lets you iterate over arrays:\n\u003cul\u003e {{#each employee as |name|}}\u003cli\u003e{{name}}\u003c/li\u003e {{/each}}\u003c/ul\u003e Given:\n{  employee: [\"Ryan B'Oul\", \"Mike Balcoome\", \"Maddie Lehane\"] } The template renders:\n\u003cul\u003e  \u003cli\u003eRyan B'Oul\u003c/li\u003e  \u003cli\u003eMike Balcoome\u003c/li\u003e  \u003cli\u003eMaddie Lehane\u003c/li\u003e \u003c/ul\u003e Similarly, if conditions let you show or hide content based on data:\n{{#if manager}}\u003ch1\u003e{{firstname}}{{lastname}}\u003c/h1\u003e {{/if}}If manager is true, the heading appears; if not, it’s hidden. Helpers let you add simple logic to templates without cluttering your code.\nCreating Custom Helpers You can extend Ember’s capabilities by writing your own helpers. For instance, you might create a helper to format dates or combine multiple properties. This keeps your templates clean and your logic reusable.\nInspecting the App with Ember Inspector To better understand Kianda’s components and data, you can use the Ember Inspector—a browser add-on that helps you explore the internal structure of Ember apps. With it, you can:\n Inspect components and their properties. Understand the data models and routes. See which templates are used for specific UI elements.  How to Get Started with Ember Inspector:\n Install the Ember Inspector from the Chrome Web Store or your browser’s add-ons marketplace. Open your Kianda workspace and log in. Right-click on the page and select Inspect. Navigate to the Ember tab in the developer tools. Explore components, routes, and data to learn how Kianda’s UI is constructed.  Components and Properties In Kianda, many UI elements—like fields, rules, and dashboard widgets—are implemented as Ember components. By inspecting them with the Ember Inspector, you can discover their properties and understand how they’re rendered. This knowledge can guide you when creating your own custom widgets or applying advanced customizations.\n In Summary:\nEmber.js and Handlebars provide a robust foundation for Kianda’s dynamic interfaces. Handlebars lets you write simple, declarative templates tied directly to your data, while Ember’s helpers and components help keep your application organized and responsive. Combined with tools like the Ember Inspector, these technologies give you the power to understand and customize Kianda’s front-end to suit your needs.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Kianda’s front-end is built on Ember.js, a framework designed for …","ref":"/low-code/emberjs/","tags":"","title":"Introduction to Ember.js in Kianda"},{"body":"Introduction The Hide / Show column rule allows you change the visibility of a selected column within a table in a process. You can either disable or enable the property, you can also toggle between both of the visible states.\nWhen to use You can use this rule to hide or show specific columns in your table. This rule is often used when hiding private data from users that do not need access to it. For example you can choose to show total earning column of a table to your managers but not other employees. You can also apply this rule to a button and give it the toggle function which will allow you to toggle the visible property of a column.\nYou can add this rule:\n to a field to a form to a process (the rule will run on load)  Before you get started For this rule to work you need to have one or more tables in your process.

Kianda has the ability to read users’ profiles, extract data, update users and groups and enable Single Sign-On (SSO). The Office 365 datasource can be used for example to automatically import users using a scheduled task within Kianda or with individual Kianda processes to update the configuration of users and groups within Office 365.\nWhen to use If you have an Office 365 subscription, you can create an Office 365 data connector so that Kianda can access data and manipulate data at that data source.\nNote: To create this datasource you need to have an Administrator or Manage datasources role in Kianda. You also need to be an administrator in Office 365.\nHow to get started An Office 365 data connector can be configured by users with the role Administrator or Manage datasources. These users can access the datasource management function, found under Administration \u003e Data sources.\n  From the Kianda home page, click on Administration \u003e Data sources.\n  In the main view you will see any existing data sources that have been created.

Kianda provides predefined datasource connectors such as the SQL server and SharePoint to allow you to connect your Kianda forms to particular data sources. A complete list of these predefined datasources is available at Data connectors. In addition to these predefined connectors, you can also create Custom connectors to enable you to configure your own connector to suit your needs.\nCustom connectors work in the same way as other Kianda connectors, but with the added benefit of customisation.\nWhat are Custom Connectors used for? Custom connectors provide the infrastructure to allow developers to create a custom datasource, it provides hooks for pre- and post-processing of the query and the ability to customise the datasource settings for the connector.\nCustom Connector VS Datasource As previously mentioned, the Kianda platform provides a list of predefined datasource connectors, such as SharePoint, SQL server and SAP. These however cannot be customized for an individual companies needs.\nCustom Connectors provide end-to-end customisation for datasource connections. The Custom Connector provides the architecture to allow customisation of pre- and post-processing of database queries.\nFor example when using a SharePoint data source you can use parameters for example selection of the environment and user credentials, but if you needed extra parameter, you could use the custom connector to provide this ability.\nHow to get started There are three key steps that need to be implemented in order to create and use a customised connector as follows:\n  Microservice - create a microservice that will implement metadata, query and test functions. \u003c!– click on the Microservice link to get further details. –\u003e\n  Use Kianda features to create and test your customised connector - use Developer to register a new connector\u003c!– register a new connector –\u003e and use Data sources to \u003c!– create a datasource –\u003e create a datasource for the newly customised connector. Both of these features are available under Administration\n  Process - use the custom connector to bring data into a process and use the query hook to filter the data. Use Kianda Designer to connect your data source to Kianda forms, for example a List control can connect to a datasource, see step 9 in List control.\n  What’s next  To create a test service, follow the 3 steps above, or if you have already created a microservice go straight to steps to create a custom connector to learn how to create a custom connector.\n","categories":"","description":"Learn about custom connectors, what they are and why they are used","excerpt":"Learn about custom connectors, what they are and why they are used","ref":"/low-code/custom-connector/","tags":"","title":"Custom Connectors"},{"body":"Introduction Within your Kianda platform, you have the option to create your own custom widgets if the many pre-configured fields, rules or dashboard elements do not suit. Naturally, you might want to troubleshoot your created code if it does not perform as expected. This page will outline and detail several important code debugging practices you can implement in your custom widget to ensure correct operation. As well as this, some of these methods can be applied to troubleshoot your own custom connectors within your platform.\nPrerequisites Before getting started, open a custom widget of your choice in code edit mode within Kianda Developer. For example choose features within rule, field, dashboard elements that require debugging.\nCustom widget debugging practices There are several methods of debugging your custom field, rule, and dashboard widgets listed below. You can also investigate and understand Ember.js on your Kianda platform via the Ember.js inspector, an an open-source JavaScript web application framework that allows you to build highly interactive applications that use JavaScript in a quick and efficient manner.\nOn this page, we will look at using Google Chrome Developer Tools, however most web browsers provide web analysis and debugging tools such as Mozilla Firefox Developer Tools and Safari Web Inspector.\nDeveloper console You can simply print information relating to your widget within the developer console by utilising JavaScript methods such as getElementsByClassName on the document object. Depending on the code you have written, this method can be useful in returning attributes of your chosen array of classes.\nTo print debugging messages to the console:\n  Navigate to a process that features the custom field or rule you would like to troubleshoot, or alternatively in this case, navigate to the dashboard that features the custom dashboard widget you would like to troubleshoot.\n  Right click on the page and select Inspect.\n  Within the developer tools window, click on the Console tab. From here you can write various queries and debugging snippets that can aid in the troubleshooting process.\nIn this example, we are looking at a custom dashboard widget that features a frequently asked questions (FAQ) accordion. Each question division has the class name of accordionTrainingDashboard, so to obtain the attributes of each division, we query a chosen index of the array of divisions and add the .attributes element to the end:\ndocument.getElementsByClassName(\"accordionTrainingDashboard\")[2].attributes;  \u003e NamedNodeMap {0: class, 1: data-ember-action, 2: data-ember-action-1163,  class: class, data-ember-action: data-ember-action,  data-ember-action-1163: data-ember-action-1163, length: 3} This code displays various attributes relating to the third question in the FAQ accordion, however other properties and methods can be called in the developer console instead of .attributes:\n .style - to view the custom CSS that is being applied to the HTML. For more on this, see Global CSS File. .focus() - if your HTML elements appear to be hidden or out of focus, the .focus() method snaps the browser view to the elements position. .innerHTML - returns the HTML content within the selected element, useful for analysing and manipulating content.    Console.log() method The console.log() method is a useful JavaScript method that prints out values that are passed into it as a parameter. This is useful for troubleshooting logical problems within your code at any point to ensure the correct operation of your widget.\nFor example within a custom field widget’s actual source code, you might want to confirm the value of a file URL field by adding a console.log() statement after the variable is declared and initialised:\nvar fileURLField = process.findFieldByName(this.get(\"rule.settings.fileURL.name\"));  console.log(fileURLField);  fileURLField.set(\"text\", \"https://xyz.kianda.com/api/file/kianda-data/?file=\"+sourceField.data.value[0].fileUrl); In this example, the URL will be printed to the developer console before calling the .set method to it to ensure the correct URL is being set.\nDebugger function The debugger function is a JavaScript function that allows for troubleshooting your code in a step-by-step process using code breakpoints. When the debugger function is called, any values that were declared and initialised, or any calculations that were made will be highlighted and displayed in the developer tools tab Sources.\nTo use the debugger function:\n  Navigate to a process that features the custom field or rule you would like to troubleshoot.\n  Right click on the page and select Inspect.\n  Within the developer tools window, click on the Sources tab.\n  From here, execute your code/begin entering data into your custom widget.\nAs seen in the image below:\n Clicking on the Play/pause button will begin executing the code. The code execution pauses when it reaches the debugger function. If you would like to execute the code until the next debugger function, click on the Play/pause button again. The values/calculations are displayed under the Script heading in the bottom right-hand corner and will be updated on each iteration. You can choose to select further code Breakpoints by ticking the checkboxes beside Pause on uncaught exceptions and Pause on caught exceptions.  The debugger function operates similarly to the Rule debugger with its iterative, step-by-step stage based troubleshooting flow.\nOther debugging practices There are several other useful debugging practices you can implement within your Kianda platform:\n Console.error() - this method similar to console.log() outputs an error message to the developer console with a red warning symbol. Try - catch statements - you can wrap your code in a try - catch block so that expected errors are handled appropriately. This is a preventative measure for certain scenarios such as a user entering invalid data. Other developer tools like:  Network tab to monitor and analyse network activity between the client and server - useful for investigating bottlenecks and throttling such as uploading large files. Throttling is described as intentionally slowing down your network speed to imitate scenarios where a poor network connection might occur. Elements tab allows you to inspect the nested HTML structure of your page and visualise any applied CSS styles, as well as allowing manipulation via the box model visualiser. Performance tab showcases JavaScript execution, memory usage and more. It differs from the network tab in that it analyses overall performance as opposed to specific requests.

PowerShell is a command-line interface (CLI) based tool that allows to automate tasks and configurations using code. With PowerShell you are able to create scripts and functionality to automate tasks within your organisation and the PowerShell connector allows you to call those PowerShell scripts from within Kianda. You can call your scripts with the Data rules that are available, use input mapping to pass parameters to your PowerShell script and receive the outcome of the script using results mapping. To learn more about input and result mapping visit one of the Data rules, for example Create Item.\nWhen to use You can use the PowerShell connector when you want run a PowerShell script from within your Kianda subscription. Any data that you to be passed into a script can be passed in using the input mapping functionality from Data rules. This allows you to have dynamic usage of your PowerShell scripts as you can have different value each time you call a script from Kianda.\nBefore you get started In advance of using the PowerShell data connector, there are a couple of prerequisites to establish a working connection between your PowerShell scripts and Kianda.\n Downloading Kianda Cloud Connect Creating a new local PowerShell user Changing user rights assignment Changing Execution Policy for the new user Running Kianda Cloud Connect as PowerShell user  Downloading Kianda Cloud Connect Kianda Cloud Connect is a piece of software that establishes a connection between your local machine and your Kianda subscription. This lightweight app will sit on your PC or server where files reside that you need to use in Kianda processes. It allows the data to travel from your local machine to the Kianda Cloud Connect service, and then the Kianda Cloud Connect service sends data to your Kianda subscription. This data transfer works both ways depending on what operation you are performing for example Deleting a file or Creating one.\nTo learn more about how to download and create a connection between your Kianda subscription and Kianda Cloud Connect go to Kianda Cloud Connect.\nCreating a new local PowerShell user We need to create a local user on your computer and designate it when running the Kianda Cloud Connect app on your computer.

This option is used to select the PC connection that contains your PowerShell scripts and config.json file   Status - represents the current status of the connection.  incomplete - means that the details of the connector were not fully completed. test failed - means that the details of the connector are incorrect and the connection has failed. ready - means that the connector has successfully connected and its ready to be used.      When you have added PowerShell details, you are ready to test your connection and add security. At the bottom of the PowerShell Connector page, click on Test connection button and if the service has been correctly configured, then you should receive a notification saying Connection test succeeded.\n  Click on Save to save the connection and you will receive a notification saying Details saved successfully.\n  Add Security settings by clicking on the Security button, go to Setting security for data sources for more details.\n  Click on Close to close the details page and return to the data source management main view.\n  Adding new PowerShell scripts to your connector When installing Kianda Cloud Connect, a folder called PowerShellScripts should be located at:\nC:/Program Files (x86)/Kianda Technologies\nThis folder will be used to store your a config.json. The config.json file is used to define new PowerShell scripts in the Scripts array. Import to note is to put the correct path to your script in the Path parameter of your script object and to set the Enabled parameter to true. In the image below, you can see an example of a config.json file that contains one Script Object in the Scripts array. To define more scripts in the array, simply add another Script Object to your array by separating them with a , (comma).\nconfig.json file: {  \"Notes\": \"This is the PowerShell manifest file. System administrators can define new PowerShell scripts under the 'Scripts' array\",  \"Scripts\": [  {  \"Description\": \"Sample PowerShell module used to add days to now date\",  \"Name\": \"AddDaysToNow\",  \"Path\": \"C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Kianda Technologies\\\\PowerShellScripts/AddDaysToNow.ps1\",  \"Enabled\": true,  \"Parameters\": [  {  \"Description\": \"\",  \"Name\": \"Days\",  \"Type\": \"NUMBER\",  \"Value\": 2  }  ]  }  ] } The Parameters array is used to define dynamic parameters for example to pass in values from Kianda into your PowerShell script. Taking the above config.json file and the below AddDaysToNow.ps1 file as an example:\nAddDaysToNow.ps1 file: Param([int]$Days = 2) $Now = Get-Date $Date = $Now.AddDays($Days) $Date.ToString(\"dd/MM/yyyy\") In our Script Object of our config.json file we have a parameter called Days.

SAP is an enterprise resource planning software which allows you centralises data between all areas of your business and manage them in one SAP system.\nData in the SAP system are represented with schemas and tables. Each schema represents an area of your business and tables represent data within that business area. Using SAP as your datasource, you can perform Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) operations on tables within your SAP system using the Data rules provided in the Kianda platform. When using the SAP connector, keep in mind that you can perform CRUD operations on data within a tables of the system, but you cannot perform CRUD operations on tables themselves, this mean are unable to create or delete tables.\nSAP connector also has the ability to use Business Application Programming Interface (BAPI) functions through Kianda. This allows you to perform particular business tasks in your SAP system by calling BAPI functions using the Data rules provided.\nWhen to use You can use the SAP connector when you want access or modify data within a standard SAP or custom table in your SAP system. You can connect the SAP connector to a List field as its datasource, meaning you can access information from a table and display the information that is stored in the table. Take a standard SAP table MARA as an example, using this table you can display information on your Kianda forms using the data within the MARA table. You can also display information of your custom made tables within your SAP system.\nBefore getting started You need to create a Kianda Cloud Connect connection with your device which will be used in the settings when filling out the SAP connector settings.

When you connect a SAP connector as your datasource, you can choose which Table or BAPI you want to use when performing CRUD operations. For example when connecting a SQL datasource to a List field and selecting a table you want to use, the parameters will depend on what data are present in the tables. Take standard SAP Table MARA as an example. We have an Employee table which we select when connecting a datasource to a List field, to learn how to a datasource to a list field go to List control, see image below:\nThe list of parameters displayed in the the Display field, Value field and Sort by field will match the columns that we have in the Employee table, see image below:\nSAP BAPI functions In order to use BAPI functions from your SAP system effectively, the Data rules within Kianda can be used. Data rules allow you to send data as well as receive it. For example if your BAPI function needs data when calling it, you can use any of the Data rules for example Create item rule to send data using the input mapping section or when receiving data you can use the on success mapping.\nTake a BAPI function which retrieves a list from your SAP system as an example. You can use the on success mapping to store the list in a Kianda field. If for example this BAPI function takes an argument where you want to specify how many items from the list it retrieves, you can input that information in to the input mapping section of the data rules.

If you add help text, a question mark icon will appear next to the field title and, if the user clicks on this, they will see the help text you have inserted.\n  Custom CSS class name - You can type the name of a CSS class to allow the Button to inherit specific styles defined in the Global CSS file.\n  Button size - You can choose the size of the Button ranging from XL (extra large) to XS (extra small). By default, the Button size is medium.\n  Block button - If you choose Yes, the button will span the entire width of the button’s allocated space. If you choose No, an additional field called Align button will appear that allows you to select what direction the Button aligns to. By default, the Button is aligned to the center.\n  Color scheme - You can choose a colour for your new Button field from six options.\n  Icon - You can choose an icon to appear on your Button by clicking on the down arrow to the right and scrolling to select the icon you want to use (or can opt not to add an icon).\n   Show in form body - Select Yes if you want your Button to be shown in the Form.\n  Enable button security - Select Yes if you want to limit who can see the Button you are adding to the form.\nIf you select Yes, two additional options are displayed: Add security and Allow anonymous link.\nWhen you click on Add security, a new line appears with the options Field security and Select user(s) or groups:\nIn Field security, you can choose from three options in terms of who will be able to view the Button you are inserting:\n(i) If you choose to limit the Button visibility to a ‘User or group’, you can then select the user(s) or groups you want to be able to see the Button in the ‘Select user(s) or groups’ box.\n(ii) If you choose to limit the Button visibility to a ‘User picker field’, you then select the User picker field in the ‘Select a userpicker field’ box:\nThis will limit the visibility of the Button to the user(s) selected in that User picker field.\n(iii) If you choose to limit the Button visibility to ‘Form owner(s)’, you then select the form in the ‘Select a form’ box - only the owner(s) of the selected form will be able to view the new Button you are inserting:\nThe second main option in terms of Button security is ‘Allow anonymous link’:\n  If you choose Yes, this will mean that the Button field will be visible when the form is accessed via an anonymous link.\n  If you choose No, anyone accessing the form from an anonymous link will not be able to see the Button field.\n  Anonymous links can be useful if, for example, you want members of the public to complete your form without needing to log into Kianda. To learn more about how you can create anonymous links to a form that can be shared with external users, see Anonymous form link.\n  Once you complete the New field - Button dialog box, click OK and the new Button field is added to your form.\n  In our example, if we changed the Button field title to ‘Schedule Meeting’ and chose a green colour scheme and ‘people’ icon, set button size to small and aligned the button to the right, our new Button could look like this when added to our ‘Performance Plan’ form:\n  You may then decide to add rules to your new Button field - to learn more, go to Rules. The rules we add will be executed in the order in which they are listed under Rules in the right hand pane.\nFor example, we could add a series of rules to our new Schedule Meeting button:\nIn our example, the sixth rule is a Meeting Request rule which will mean that, once the Schedule Meeting button is clicked, an automated email will be sent to the employee scheduling a performance review meeting - to learn more, go to Meeting request rule.\n  How to edit, move and delete Button fields To edit a Button field:\n  Select the Button field (by either clicking on the field name or on the field’s drag handle button ).\n  Click on the Edit Field button (Pen icon) .\n  The Edit Field dialog box will open (with the Button title you chose reflected in the dialog box name), enabling you to choose from the same range of options as appear in the New field - Button dialog box (as already discussed in How to get started).\n  To move a Button, simply:\n  Select the Button’s Drag handle button .\n  Drag and drop the Button wherever you want to move it within your form.\nFor example, the ‘Schedule Meeting’ Button could be moved from where it was automatically added at the bottom of the panel to the location where we want it to go:\n  To delete a Button from your form:\n Select the Button (by either clicking on the Button’s title or its drag handle button ). Click on the Bin/Trash button . Click on OK to confirm.  How to view and edit Button field properties To view or edit a Button’s Field properties:\n  Select the Button field (by either clicking on the field title or on the field’s drag handle button ).\n  The Field Properties associated with the Button field will be displayed (and can be changed) in the Field properties menu to the right.\nFor example, the Field Properties associated with a Button field titled ‘Schedule Meeting’ are shown here and include:\n Field type - The type of field, in this case a Button. Title - The Title of the field, in this case ‘Schedule Meeting’. Show title - If this is selected, the Button field title will be shown in the form. Required - If this is selected, the Button will be mandatory for the form user. Enabled - If this is selected, the user will be able to edit or interact with the field. Visible - If this is selected, the Button will be visible in the form. Layout - The width of the blue bar can be adjusted to change the width of the Button as it appears on a PC or mobile phone (to view the Mobile layout, click on the expand button to the right).    ​\tFor more details, go to Field Properties.\nSaving changes and version history Make sure to save any changes you make by clicking on the Save button .

We will keep this example in mind as we learn more about using the Field group control.\nHow to get started   To add a Field group to a form, first open the relevant process - in our case, we will open the Education Request Process.\n  Then select the form within that process that you want to add the field to (so that the Edit Form button is visible) - we will select the ‘Training Approval’ form.

You can expand forms (listed with a plus sign beside them) to view all of the fields within them by clicking on the form title in the list. Select as many fields as you want.\nIn our example, we will select three fields in the ‘Training Request’ form that we want to be shown on the ‘Training Approval’ form - Employee Name, Type of Training and Reason:\n  Grouped fields - The field(s) you select will automatically be grouped together in the Grouped fields section at the bottom of the dialog box - click on Grouped fields so that it expands to show the list of fields you have chosen:\nThe fields you have chosen being ‘grouped’ together will mean that you will be able to edit them and move them around your form as a group (rather than as individual fields).\nIf there is a field or fields you do not want to be grouped, simply click on the Bin/Trash icon to the right and that field will no longer be grouped with the others.\nYou can also change the order of the fields within the Field group by simply clicking on the field’s drag handle button and dragging and dropping the field where you want it to be.\nNote that selected fields grouped under the current field group are not copied only referenced.\n  Once you have completed the New field - Field group dialog box, click OK and the new Field group will be added to your form.\n  By default, the Title of the new Field group will not be shown (unless you choose to display it, by selecting the Show title checkbox in the Field properties menu to the right).\nIn our example, our new Field group contains the three fields we chose:\nHow to edit, move and delete Field groups To edit a Field group:\n Select the field (by either clicking on the field title or on the field’s Drag handle button ).

One such rule that can be used in conjunction with the Dialog field is the Show, hide or disable rule - to learn more, see Show, hide or disable.\nFor example, in a simple Training Request form that employees can complete if they want to request training, it could be useful to insert a Dialog field so that a reminder message pops up when the employee clicks on the Save or Submit buttons, to remind them to check that they have completed all fields before they submit their form. We will keep this example in mind as we learn more about Dialog fields.\nTo view a video example of how to create a Modal dialog field, see How to create a modal dialog.\nHow to get started   To add a Modal dialog field to a form, first open the relevant process.\n  Then select the form within that process that you want to add the field to (so that the Edit Form button is visible).

This is because, as already mentioned, Dialog fields are typically used in conjunction with a rule being applied to a field or button - such as the Submit or Save buttons - so that the pop-up message is only shown to users in certain circumstances, rather than being displayed in the form all the time.\nIn our example of the Training Request form, we may only want the Dialog to display when the user clicks on either Submit or Save, to remind them to check that they have completed all fields.\n  How to set the heading for the Dialog The title of the Dialog field will display as the heading at the top of the pop-up Dialog message. By default, the title of the new Dialog field is ‘Dialog 1’.\nTo change the title of a Dialog field:\n Select the new Dialog field (by either clicking on the drag handle or clicking in the area of the Dialog field) so that the Edit field button is visible. Edit the Title in the Field properties panel to the right.  For example, we could decide to give our pop-up Dialog message a heading of ‘Reminder’.

First, select the Dialog field (so that the Edit field button is visible) and then go to the Controls menu and click on the field type you want to insert.\nThe Richtext field is a very flexible option to use for the body of the pop-up message as it gives you the most options - such as formatting and styling the text or inserting images or links. We will use a Richtext field to step through how to add text to the body of the Dialog field for our Training Request form.\n  Select the Dialog field and then insert a Richtext field into it by clicking Controls \u003eLayout \u003eRichtext in the right-hand pane. To learn more about Richtext fields, go to Richtext control.\n  A New field - Richtext dialog box will open:\n  Title - You can change the title of the Richtext field from the default ‘Richtext 1’.

This option is not as relevant to the Dialog field as it is to other fields, as the Dialog field is not a field the user needs to complete.\n  Custom CSS class name - You can type the name of a CSS class to allow the Richtext to inherit specific styles defined in the Global CSS file.\n  Richtext - Type the text that you want to be shown as the main body text in the pop-up Dialog into this field and format it as you want - there are options to highlight text, change the font style and font colour, bold, underline, increase or decrease font size, use a bulleted or numbered list, format the text to align left/centre/right, insert a table or a link, insert an image or to switch to code view.\n  Colour scheme - You can choose from five colour options for the colour that will appear in the background behind the Dialog richtext body text.\nFor our example of the Training Request form, we will insert text to remind the employee completing the form to check that they have completed all fields before submitting it and will choose an orange background colour:\n  Once you have completed the New field - Richtext dialog box, click OK. You will now see the body text of your Dialog field in the Richtext field you added to it:\n  To preview how the pop-up Dialog will look tp users, either click on the Dialog Preview button or click on the eye symbol :  Click on Close or OK to close the preview.  How to edit, move and delete Modal dialog fields As we go through the options available for editing, moving or deleting a Modal dialog field in a form, we will keep in mind our example of the ‘Reminder’ pop-up Dialog in the Training Request form.\nHow to edit a Modal dialog field To edit a Modal dialog field:\n  Select the Dialog field (by either clicking on the drag handle or clicking in the area of the Dialog field).\n  Then click on the Edit field button (Pen icon) .\n  The Edit field - Dialog dialog box will open, enabling you to choose from a range of options (we already changed the Dialog field title to ‘Reminder’ so this name will be shown in the dialog box name):\nThe options within the Edit field - Dialog dialog box include:\n    Title - You can change the title of the Modal Dialog field here. We already changed it to ‘Reminder’ from the default Dialog 1 in the ‘Title’ field in the Field properties pane.\n  Name - This is a unique name for the field\n  Help text - You can insert text to help the form user. If you add help text, a question mark icon will appear next to the field title and, if the user clicks on this, they will see the help text you have inserted. This option is less relevant for the Dialog field as it is for other field types, as the Dialog field is not a field the user needs to complete.\n  Custom CSS class name - You can type the name of a CSS class to allow the Dialog to inherit specific styles defined in the Global CSS file.\n  Hide “OK” button - Select Yes if you do not want the user to see an ‘OK’ button at the bottom of the Dialog message.\n  Hide “Close” button - Select Yes if you do not want the user to see a ‘Close’ button at the bottom of the Dialog message.\n  Enable dismiss (X button right top) - Choosing Yes means an X button (that the user can click on to dismiss the pop-up message) will be shown at the top right of the Dialog.\n  Dialog size - You can choose from the Default size or Large size for your Dialog message.\n   Once you have finished editing the Dialog field in the Edit field - Dialog dialog box, click on the OK button to save your changes or click on Close to exit the dialog box without saving.\n  To see how your form or Dialog field will look on a mobile, view it in Mobile preview by using the Preview option which can be opened by clicking the play button icon . You also have the options to see how it will look on a PC or tablet.\n  How to move a Modal dialog field To move a Modal dialog field:\n  Select the field’s Drag handle button .\n  Drag and drop it wherever you want to move it within your form.\n  How to delete a Modal dialog field To delete a Modal dialog field from your form:\n Select it (by either clicking on the Panel field’s name or its Drag handle button ). Click on the Bin/Trash button . Click on OK to confirm the deletion (or click Cancel if you wish to cancel the deletion).  How to edit Modal dialog field properties To view or edit the field properties associated with a Modal dialog field, select the Dialog field (by clicking on the drag handle button or clicking in the area of the Dialog field) - the Field properties menu will appear in the right-hand pane.\nIn the example shown here, a Dialog field titled ‘Reminder’ has been selected and the Field properties associated with it are shown in the Field properties menu to the right:\n Title - The title of the Modal Dialog field. In this case, ‘Reminder’. Layout - How wide the Modal Dialog field will be on a PC and mobile phone, denoted by the width of the blue bar. You can change the width by clicking on the blue bar.  Saving changes and version history Make sure to save any changes you make by clicking on the Save button . You will always have the option to revert back to previous versions of your form by clicking the Design Version History button in the top right corner.\nWhat’s next  Now that you’ve learned about the Modal dialog control, find out more about the other types of Layout fields you can add to a Kianda process:\n Field group control Panel layout control Richtext control  ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"The Modal dialog field allows you to design pop-up dialog messages …","ref":"/platform/controls/layout/dialog/","tags":"","title":"Modal dialog control"},{"body":"A Panel field is section within a form. Panels hold other elements of your form, such as text box fields, list fields and tables, and enable flexible layout options that result in a better end-user experience.\nIt is a good idea when first creating a form to insert a panel for each section of your form and then insert the fields you require into each of these panels. One advantage of having related fields contained within a panel is that you can then easily move that panel (and all of the fields within it) to another location within your form.\nFor example, in a ‘Training Request’ form, you may decide to insert two panels - one panel to contain the details relating to the employee requesting the training and a second panel to contain the details of the training course being requested.\nHow to get started   To add a Panel to a form, first open the relevant process.\n  Then select the form within that process that you want to add the field to (so that the Edit Form button is visible). Go to Create First Process to learn how to create your first process.\n  Insert the Panel by clicking on Controls in the left-hand pane to expand the Controls menu.\n  Select Layout to view the range of Layout controls and click on Panel.\nA pop-up message will appear saying ‘Field added’ and a panel field with the default name Panel 1 will be added to your form.\nBy default, the title of the new panel will not be displayed in your form, but you can make it visible by selecting the ‘Show title’ checkbox in the Field properties panel to the right) - to learn more about editing the Field properties associated with Panels, go to How to edit Panel field properties.\n  How to edit, move and delete Panels As we go through the options available for editing a Panel in a form, we will keep in mind the example of adding two panels to a ‘Training Request’ form - one titled ‘Employee Details’ and one titled ‘Training Details’.\nHow to edit a Panel To edit a Panel:\n  Select the field.\n  Click on the Edit field button (Pen icon) .\nThe Edit field - Panel dialog box will open, enabling you to choose from a range of options:\n  Title - You can change the title of the Panel from the default ‘Panel 1’.\nIn our example, after inserting two panels into our form, we could edit each of them in turn and change their titles to ‘Employee Details’ and ‘Training Details’.\nIn order to have the title of a Panel display in your form, you need to take one further step - select each panel and then select the ‘Show title’ checkbox in the Field properties panel to the right. Now the titles of the two Panels will be shown - here we have selected the first panel in order to display the ‘Show title’ checkbox associated with it:\nYou will learn more about the Field properties associated with Panels in How to edit Panel Field properties.\n  Name (unique) - This is a unique name for the Panel field and inherits a camel case version of the entered Title.\n  Help text - You can insert text to help the form user to complete the Panel.\nIn our example, we could insert this help text to assist the user in completing the ‘Employee Details’ panel:\nIf you add help text, a question mark icon will appear next to the Panel title and, if the user clicks on this, they will see the help text you have inserted.\n  Custom CSS class name - You can type the name of a CSS class to allow the panel to inherit specific styles defined in the Global CSS file.\n  Card design? - This option allows you to add a border radius to your panel, which rounds the edges. If you select the Yes radio button, you can choose between defining:\n  The total border radius in pixels by clicking the all corners button and entering a value into the input field.\n  Each corner’s border radius individually in pixels by clicking on the individual corners button and entering values for each corner in the four input fields.\nThis feature can give your forms an added level of unique styling.\n    Layout columns - Here you can decide how wide you want your Panel to be in your form - choose from 1 to 12 columns in width. For example click half-way across the blue bar to create a panel that is 6 columns wide, or click at the far right side of the blue bar to create a column that is 12 columns wide.\n  Colour scheme - You can choose from six different colour options: navy, green, blue, amber, red, white. By default, the colour is set to white.\n  Enable panel security - If you want to restrict who can see the contents of the Panel, choose Yes. Two additional options will then be shown - ‘Add security’ and ‘Allow anonymous link’:\nTo limit who can view the Panel contents, click the ‘Add security’ button. A new row is displayed, within which you can select the user(s) or groups who will be able to vie the Panel:\nIn Field security, you can choose from three options in terms of who will be able to view the Panel you are inserting: User or group, User picker field or Form owner(s).\n(i) If you choose to limit the Panel visibility to a ‘User or group’, you can then select the user(s) or groups you want to be able to see it in the ‘Select user(s) or groups’ box.\n(ii) If you choose to limit the Panel visibility to a ‘User picker field’, you then select the User picker field in the ‘Select a userpicker field’ box:\nThis will limit the visibility of the Panel to the user(s) selected in that User picker field.\n(iii) If you choose to limit the Panel visibility to ‘Form owner(s)’, you then select the form in the ‘Select a form’ box - only the owner(s) of the selected form will be able to view the Panel you are inserting:\nThe second main option in terms of Panel security is ‘Allow anonymous link’:\n  If you choose Yes, this will mean that the Panel will be visible when the form is accessed via an anonymous link.\n  If you choose No, anyone accessing the form from an anonymous link will not be able to see the Panel.\n  Anonymous links can be useful if, for example, you want members of the public to complete your form without needing to log into Kianda. To learn more about how you can create anonymous links to a form that can be shared with external users, see Anonymous form link.\n  Once you are finished editing the Panel in the Edit field dialog box, click on the OK button to save your changes or click on Close to exit the dialog box without saving.\n  How to add fields to a Panel Once you have inserted a Panel and completed the Edit field - Panel dialog box, you can then start to add the elements you need into the Panel - such as text boxes, lists, tables, number fields or date fields. Go to Controls to see the full list of fields available and Rules to learn about different categories of rules that can be applied.\nTo add fields to your Panel:\n Select the Panel (by either clicking on the field title or on the field’s Drag handle button ) so that the Edit field button is visible. Click on whatever type of field you want to insert from the Controls menu in the left-hand pane.  Let’s take the example of our first Panel, titled ‘Employee Details’. To add a Text box field to this Panel we can:\n Select the Panel by clicking on the ‘Employee Details’ field Drag handle. Click on Controls \u003e Input \u003e Text box in the Controls menu to insert a Text box. A pop-up message says ‘Field added’ and a new Text box, titled ‘Text box 1’, is added to the ‘Employee Details’ panel:  You can then edit this new Text box field as needed - in our example, we will rename it as ‘First Name’. To learn more about Text box fields, go to Text box control.  By adding two text box fields (titled ‘First Name’ and ‘Surname’) and a date field (titled ‘Date of Birth’) to our ‘Employee Details’ Panel, and then adding the fields we need to the ‘Training Details’ Panel, our ‘Training Request’ form - with its two Panels - could look like this when viewed on a user’s mobile phone:\nTo see how your form or field will look on a mobile, view it in Mobile preview by using the Preview option which can be opened by clicking the play button icon . You also have the options to see how it will look on a PC or tablet.\nHow to move a Panel To move a Panel, simply:\n Select the Panel field’s Drag handle button . Drag and drop it wherever you want to move it within your form.  How to delete a Panel To delete a Panel from your form:\n Select it (by either clicking on the Panel field’s name or its Drag handle button ), click on the Bin/Trash button  Click on OK to confirm or click on Cancel if you wish to cancel the deletion.  Note: Remember that deleting a Panel will result in all of the fields contained within that Panel also being deleted.\nHow to edit Panel Field properties To view or edit the field properties associated with a Panel, select the Panel field (by clicking on the field title or drag handle button ) - the Field properties menu will appear in the right-hand pane.\nIn the example shown here, the Field properties associated with the ‘Employee Details’ Panel include:\n Field type - the type of field. In this case, Panel. Title - the title of the Panel field (default name ‘Panel 1’ unless you change it). In this case, ‘Employee Details’. Show title - this is selected, which means that the Panel title will be shown in the form. Visible - this is selected, so the Panel will be visible to form users. Layout - the width of the blue bars can be adjusted to change the width of the Richtext field on PC or mobile. To view the mobile width, click on the expand button to the right of the Layout option.  To learn more about the different options within the Field properties menu, go to Field Properties.\nSaving changes and version history Make sure to save any changes you make by clicking on the Save button .

This is achieved by creating a process and scheduling the process to run before the Access Token expires.\nHow to get started Create a datasource First you will need to create the datasource to connect to the application, for example, creating a REST Service with two REST Methods. The method titled Get/Refresh Auth Token will be used to refresh the Access Token with the scheduled task. For more information on how to create REST Services go to the REST Service page.\nThere are five parameters to pass into the request body: grant_type, client_id, client_secret, redirect_url and refresh token, shown below as follows:\nThese parameters need to be ‘held’ in a process, see Create a process below.\nCreate a process Once a datasource is created, a process is created which will contain fields for the parameters for the request body, and will hold fields from the response parameters.\nAs shown in the image above there are five parameters in the request body which need to be populated, and each of these parameters must correspond to a field in a process.\nIn the response body there are five parameters : access_token, token_type, expires_in, refresh_token and created_at, although only access_token, expires_in and created_at is needed. You can obtain the Access Token via the Developer console so details can be entered into Designer directly.\nA form is created using Kianda Designer with textbox fields as well as a button called Refresh as follows:\nForm rules are applied to fields in the form in the next section.\nForm rules Rules are applied to both the AccessToken textbox field and the Refresh button as follows:\n  On the Refresh button add a Data rule \u003e Set Form Field which will be used to clear the AccessToken field. Give the rule a title for example ‘Clear Access Token’ and map a ‘blank’ value to the Access Token field by ‘pressing space bar key’ as shown below:\n  On the Refresh button add a Data rule \u003e Create item which will be used to invoke the REST Service to get a new token and map the response back to the process.\n  Within the rule, click on Select data source and select the datasource created within Create a datasource, in the example on this page, ‘Sample Rest Service’.\n  Then select the ‘Get/Refresh Auth Token REST Method’ as shown below.\n  Under Input mapping map the values from the process into the request body. The left-hand column, Form field or text, represents the fields within the process or hard coded values. The right-hand column, Data source field, represents the values within the REST Service, be it the request header, request body, response header or response body**.** For example choose the form field such as grant_type and then in the data source field drill down to the value you want from the REST method.\n  In addition to the parameters defined with the REST Service the urlPath can be defined in the process and passed into the datasource. Map the form fields grant_type, client_id, client_secret, redirect_url and refresh token, into the form fields.\n  The On Success Mapping section is used to map the result from the API call back into the process. Map access_token, refresh_token, expires_in and created_at, to the relative form fields.\n    In addition to the parameters defined with the REST Service the urlPath can be defined in the process and passed into the datasource.\n  On the Refresh button add a Form action rule \u003e Save form so that the details from the process are saved to the system database. The rule order then is as follows:\n  Finally; run the Process in preview mode, ensure the details you want to pass into the REST Service are correct and save the process. Take note of the Process ID as this will be needed for setting up the Scheduled Task\nCreate the Scheduled Task\nThe final step will be to create the scheduled task that will run before the refresh token expires. Navigate to the Scheduled tasks within the Administration section in the site. Click on the Schedule a task button and fill in the dialog box.\n  Enter a name for the task in the Task Name field.\n  Under Schedule select the Minutes option. In the Every Minutes field enter a numerical value. For example, if the Access Token expires every 60 minutes, enter 55, meaning the schedule will run every 55 minutes.\n  Leave the Expire checkbox blank as this schedule should never stop.\n  Under Process Design select the name of the process that you created in the step above. This will expose a new field called Select the field or rule to trigger on schedule.\n  In Process ID enter the ID of the process that you created in preview mode.\n  In Select the field or rule to trigger on schedule select the Refresh button.\n  Click OK to save.\n  The Schedule is now set up and will refresh the access token as frequently as the time entered in the minutes field.\nNext Steps\nThe Schedule is now set up and will refresh the access token as frequently as the time entered in the minutes field. This will run indefinitely until a user chooses to delete the schedule.\nThe datasource is now available to used and the Access Token is being kept current. The Access Token can be pulled into different Processes and used to send further REST APIs.

Data from the webservice can be pulled into your Kianda workspace and manipulated, or data from Kianda can be pushed to the webservice to be used by other systems.\nWhen to use You can create a REST API datasource when you want your Kianda processes and forms to have access to a REST API.\nHow to get started A REST API data connector can be configured by users with the role Administrator or Manage datasources. These users can access the datasource management function, found under Administration \u003e Data sources.\n  In the left-hand side menu, go to Administration \u003e Data sources.\n  In the main view you will see any existing data sources that have been created. From this view, you can click on the name of a data source to see details or delete a data source by clicking on the Bin/Trash button .\n  To create a new data source, click on the Add new in the main view. A range of data source connectors will appear.\n  To add a REST Service data source click on REST Service.\n  The REST Service details screen opens.\n   Fill in the first set of fields:\n  Display name – This is the name of the data source. Use an appropriate name, as this will be used within your process(es).\n  Rest server base URL – This is the base URL of the REST API. Ensure there are no trailing characters, for example “(https:)//api.mywebsite.com”\n  Enable Certificate Authentication – By default this option is set to No. By Selecting Yes this will display two new fields:\n  Certificate (.pfx) – This is a file field which you can use to upload your authentication certificate.\n  Certificate password – Enter the password of the certificate here so the Kianda platform will be able to use it.\n       Under the Service details section, is a the REST Methods section. If there are any existing methods created, for example to find and retrieve particular information using HTTP GET, the method will be listed here. Go to REST Methods to find out more about how to add a method. To find out more about Kianda REST APIs, go to APIs.\n  Under the REST Methods on the REST Service details page, there is a check box to Use Kianda Cloud Connect? If you check this checkbox it gives you an option to Download Kianda Cloud Connect. Click on Download Kianda Cloud Connect to download a zip file.\n  When you have added REST Service details, you are ready to test your connection and add security. At the bottom of the REST Service details page, click on Test connection button and if the service has been correctly configured, then you should receive a notification saying Connection test succeeded.\nIn the event of an error, you will receive a message that relates to the error, for example a null or incorrect URL as shown in the example below:\n  Click on Save to save the connection and you will receive a notification saying Details saved successfully.\n  Add Security settings by clicking on the Security button, go to Setting security for data sources for more details.\n  Here is an example of a data connector for a REST Service called ‘Cat facts’. We will use this example to create a REST method, see section below.\nREST Methods A list of current REST Methods that have been created in Kianda will appear, listed by Name, Path and HTTP Method, where:\n  Name - is the name of the method, for example to get a list of course attendees, which could be called ‘Course Attendees’\n  Path - is the address that allows you to access the API, also called endpoints, for example /instances or /processes are endpoints for Kianda REST APIs that allow you to perform methods on process instances and process designs respectively.\n  HTTP Method - is the type of operation that can be performed on the data, namely POST (create), GET (read). PUT (update). PATCH (partial update) and DELETE (delete).\nThese details are shown in the example below, a data connector called ‘REST Service for HR’.\n  You can edit details of the existing REST Methods by clicking on the Edit/Pen button or delete a method by clicking on the Bin/Trash button .\nHow to add a new REST Method  Click on the +Add REST Method button. The REST Method editor dialog box appears.   Fill out the fields:\n  Display Name – this is the name you want to attribute to the REST Method.\n  HTTP Method – this is the HTTP Method of the REST Method.\n  Url Path – this is the rest of the URL that will be concatenated with the Rest server base URL. For example /rest/GetUserDetails.\n  Request headers – Request headers can be manually added here that need to be sent as part of the request, for example, Authorization. These values can be hard coded or passed into the Request header from the process. Click on Add header to add a request header.\n  Request body – This section is for the Request body that will be used during the request. These values can be hard coded or passed into the Request body from the process.\n  Content type – Here you can define the Content type of the body. The options are JSON and Form Data.\n  Response headers – Here you can define any response headers you wish to capture in the response that you want to use in Kianda. Click on Add header to add a response header.\n  Response body – Here you can define the response body that the request will receive. Include or remove fields as needed.\n    When you are finished editing the dialog box click on OK to save your changes, or click on Close at any time to exit.\n  See Example of REST Method use in Kianda below which can be used as a service with the connection.\nExample of REST Method use in Kianda Take an example of https://catfact.ninja/fact a well-known API that provides an endpoint to retrieve random facts about cats.\nIf a simple GET method is used to retrieve facts using an API client, then parameters are returned showing the ‘fact’ and the ’length’ of the fact as shown below.\nKnowing what parameters are available we can use the steps in How to add a new REST Method,:\n  Click on +Add REST Method from the REST Service details page, and add in details using the REST Method editor where:\n  Display Name - this is the name of your method that will be called upon in a process, for example ‘Cat fact’\n  HTTP Method - GET is used to retrieve values\n  Url Path - the path that is attached to the base URL, for example /fact\n  Click on Add Header to add request headers, for example for authentication.\n  Request body - this is the part of the request that is sent to a function where a function processes the request and sends back the Response body. For our ‘catfact ninja’ example we will use the parameters ‘fact’ and ’length’ for mapping values to form fields in Kianda processes:\n  Click on OK to save the details and then click on Save in the REST Service details screen to save the connection.\n    The method will appear under REST Methods in the details screen.\nThe next section shows how data at the data source can be used in a Kianda process.\nUsing a REST Method in a Kianda process To see how ‘catfacts’ are mapped into Kianda processes, create a new process, add fields and a rule that uses the REST Method created above.\n  To create a new process by going to the left-hand side menu \u003e Administration \u003e Designer and click on Add new and fill out details for the process, such as a Title and Description. Click on OK when complete.\n  Kianda Designer opens and in the first form, form1, add in a new text box by going to the left-hand pane and click on Controls \u003e Input \u003e Text box. This field will hold the value of the ‘fact’ from catfacts. To read more about Input controls go to Input controls.\n  Add a button to initiate the call from catfacts by going to the left-hand pane Controls \u003e Actions \u003e Button. Give the button a title for example ‘Get Cat Fact’, and choose No for Show in form body so the button appears at the bottom of the form. To read more about Action controls go to Actions.\n  To dynamically populate the textbox with a fact, we need a rule. Click on ‘Get cat fact’ button to add a rule. Then go to Rules \u003e Data \u003e Find items.\n  Give the rule a title, and under Action, click on Select data source to select the data source created using the steps in How to get started. Select the method ‘Cat fact’ created using the steps above in Example of REST Method use in Kianda.\n  Click on OK to close the dialog box.\n  If you want to add headers to the request use the Input mapping for example requests headers for authentication, otherwise click on the Bin/Trash button to delete the input mapping fields.\n  Under Results mapping select the textbox from your form for the Form field and under Data source field or text navigate to ‘fact’ from the responseBody as shown below.\n  Add Error mapping if desired. Click on the links to read more about Error mapping and Find items rule.\n  Save the process by clicking on the Save button and preview the process by clicking on Preview . In the previewed instance, click on the ‘Get Cat Fact’ button to populate the textbox.\n  What’s next  Your REST Service is now set up and ready to be used in your processes. Check out the following article on how to implement a REST Service in order to refresh an Access token.\nTo read more about APIs, go to APIs.\nTo read more about processes and forms, go to Application designer.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"One of the datasources available in Kianda is a connector to a REST …","ref":"/platform/connectors/rest/","tags":"","title":"REST Web Service"},{"body":"This video demonstrates where you can find existing templates and how to reuse forms and form elements using Import, Clone and the Group field.\nYour browser does not support the video tag.

They provide optimum formatting options, such as bold and italics, or the option to insert images or links.\nFor example, we may want to insert some colourful headings into a Training Approval form within an Education Request process (where employees can request training in a Training Request form and their manager then either approves or rejects this request in a Training Approval form).\nHow to get started   To add a Richtext field to a form, first open the relevant process - in our case, we will open the Education Request process. Go to Create First Process to learn how to create your first process.\n  Then select the form within that process to which you want to add the Richtext field (so that the Edit Form button is visible). We will select the ‘Training Approval’ form:\nThe Training Approval form contains two panels (as indicated above), neither of which currently has a heading. For the first panel, we will insert a Richtext heading titled ‘Training Details’ and, for the second panel, we will insert a Richtext heading titled ‘Approval Decision’.\n  To insert a Richtext field into the first panel in the form:\n  Select that panel by clicking on the drag handle button .\n  Then click on Controls in the left-hand pane to expand the Controls menu and select Layout to view the range of Layout controls.\n  Click on Richtext.\n    A New field - Richtext dialog box will open with a range of options you can choose from for your new Richtext field:\n   Title - You can change the title of the Richtext field from the default title of ‘Richtext 1’.\n  Name - This is a unique name for the field and inherits a camel case version of the entered Title.\n  Help text - You can insert text to help the form user - if you add help text, a question mark icon will appear next to the field title and, if the user clicks on this, they will see the help text you have inserted.\n  Custom CSS class name - You can type the name of a CSS class to allow the Richtext to inherit specific styles defined in the Global CSS file.\n  Richtext - Here you can insert the text you want to appear and can choose from an wide array of styles and formats, including Style, Colour, Bold, Underline, Remove font style, Font size, Font family, Unordered list, Ordered list, Paragraph, and Table. You can also choose to insert a Link or Picture, if you click on the Picture button you will be redirected to the File storage area where you can search for existing images stored in the Kianda file system. Here you can create a folder, upload a file and delete files.\nYou can also switch to Code view. For example, if you click on Code view button you can copy HTML code directly into the text.\nType in the text you want to use into the body of the Richtext box - in our example, we will insert the text ‘Training Details’ (the title we want to use for the first panel in our form), bold it, choose font size 14 and a blue colour scheme:\nYou can click on the Help button to get a list of over 20 keyboard shortcuts that you can use to style your text.\nClick on the Ellipsis button if you want to add an expression - see Expression builder for more details.\n  Colour scheme - You can choose from Navy, Green, Blue, Amber, Red or White Colours for your rich text background.\n  Once you have completed the New field - Richtext dialog box, click OK and the new Richtext field will be added to your form.\n  In our example, it is inserted at the bottom of the panel we added it to. The same steps can be repeated in order to insert a Richtext heading in the second panel, titled ‘Approval Decision’.\nBy default, the Richtext Title will not be shown (unless you choose to display it, by selecting the Show title checkbox in the Field properties menu to the right).\nHow to edit, move and delete Richtext fields To edit a Richtext field:\n Select the field (by either clicking on the field title or on the field’s Drag handle button ). Click on the Edit field button (Pen icon) .  The Edit field - Richtext dialog box will open, enabling you to choose from the same range of options as appear in the New field - Richtext dialog box (as already discussed in How to get started).\nTo move a Richtext field:\n Select the field’s Drag handle button . Drag and drop the field wherever you want to move it to within your form.  In our example, we can move the new Richtext heading to the top of the first panel in the Training Approval form:\nTo delete a Richtext field from your form:\n  Select the field (by clicking on the Drag handle button ).\n  Click on the Bin/Trash button .\n  Click on OK to confirm. Click on Cancel if you wish to cancel the deletion.\n  How to preview your Richtext field To see how your Richtext field or fields will look to a user on a PC or mobile phone:\n Save your changes. Click on the Preview button . Click on Desktop preview button to see how the form will look when viewed on a PC or click on the Mobile preview button to see how it will look on a mobile phone.  From our example, the new Richtext headings - ‘Training Details’ and ‘Approval Decision’ - could look like this when a user views the form on their mobile phone:\nHow to edit Richtext field properties To view or edit the field properties associated with a Richtext field, select the field (by clicking on the title or drag handle button ) - the Field properties menu will appear in the right-hand pane.\nIn the example shown here, the Field properties associated with the ‘Training Details’ Richtext field include:\n Field type - Richtext Title - the title of the Richtext field (default name ‘Richtext 1’ unless you change this) Show title - this is not selected, which means that the Richtext title will not be shown in the form Required - this is not selected, so the Richtext field is not a mandatory field for the user to complete Enabled - the field is enabled so the user can edit it (not relevant for a richtext heading which the user will not interact with) Visible - this is selected, so the Richtext field will be visible to users Layout - the width of the blue bar can be adjusted to change the width of the Richtext field on PC or mobile. To view the mobile width, click on the expand button to the right of the Layout option.  To learn more about the different options within the Field properties menu, go to Field Properties.\nSaving changes and version history Make sure to save any changes you make by clicking on the Save button .

This can be particularly useful in a form that needs to be signed off as part of an approval process.\nFor example, a manager may complete a Performance Plan form for each employee, setting out their Key Performance Areas and goals. It could be useful to add two Signature fields to this form - titled ‘Manager Signature’ and ‘Employee Signature’ - to record the Manager and Employee each signing off on the Performance Plan. We will keep this example in mind as we learn more about using Signature fields.\nHow to get started   To add a Signature field to a Kianda form:\n  Open an existing process by going to Administration \u003e Designer in the left side menu and clicking on a process, or create a new process in Designer. See Create First Process to learn how to create your first process.\n  Once you have opened your process, select the form you want to work on (so that the Edit Form button is shown).\nIn this example, we have opened an Employee Appraisal Process and selected a Performance Plan form within it:\n  Select the area within the form where you want to insert the new Signature field(s) - in our example, we want to insert one new Signature field below the ‘For Manager’ table and a second new Signature field below the ‘For Employee’ table in our Performance Plan form:\n  Click on Controls in the left-hand pane, and, from the four categories of Controls (Input, Layout, Actions and Custom), click on Actions.\n  Select Signature from the four types of Action fields: Button, Link, Image and Signature:\n  A New field - Signature dialog box will automatically open, giving you options for your new Signature field:\n  Title - You can change the name of the Signature field from the default ‘Signature 1’. In our example, we can change it to ‘Manager Signature’.\n  Name (Unique) - This is a unique name for the new field and inherits a camel case version of the entered Title.\n  Help text - You can insert text to help the form user. If you add help text, a question mark icon will appear next to the field title and, if the user clicks on this, they will see the help text you have inserted.\nFor example, we could insert this Help text to go with our new ‘Manager Signature’ Signature field:\n  Custom CSS class name - You can type the name of a CSS class to allow the Signature to inherit specific styles defined in the Global CSS file.\n  Signature pad height (pixels) - You can choose the height of the signature in pixels. To do this, either manually type in the number of pixels you want the height to be or use the up and down arrows to the right.\n  Signature color - You can choose the colour for the signature itself, i.e. the name of the user electronically signing the form. To do this, click on the field and then either:\n(i) use the slider to move between colours and click on the palette to choose a particular hue\n(ii) click on the dropper icon and then choose a colour from your open PC window(s)\n(iii) type in the R G B value if you know the colour you want to use\n  Signature thickness - Insert a numerical value for how thick you want the signature font to be. By default, this is set to 2.\n  Start signing button text - You can choose the text you want to appear on the Signature field button. By default, the text is ‘Start Signing’ but you can change this to whatever you want.\n  Re-Sign button text - You can choose the text you want to appear on the ‘Re-Sign’ button. This ‘Re-Sign’ button appears after the user has clicked the Start signing button and completed the dialog box and it enables the user to replace or override the original signature they input. By default, the text is ‘Re-sign’ but you can change this to whatever you want.\nIn our example of adding a Signature field titled ‘Manager Signature’, once the manager has signed, the ‘Re-sign’ button will be shown:\n  Show username and signing time - Select Yes to show the Kianda username of the person who has electronically signed with the Signature field and the time they signed at (per the local time settings on the user’s Kianda account).\n  Require user authentication - Select Yes to require user authentication for the user clicking the Signature field button to sign the section/form. If you select Yes, an additional option will display - Authenticate via SSO.\nIf you then choose Yes for authenticating the user via Single Sign-on, an initial pop-up box will appear to check whether the user is signed in and, after clicking on the Signature button a second pop-up will appear to confirm the user’s credentials.\nIf you choose No for Authenticate via SSO, a pop-up appears requiring the user to confirm their login credentials.\n  Hide sign by textbox - Select Yes if you want to hide the sign by textbox.\nFor example, if we choose Yes for this option for our new ‘Manager Signature’, when the user clicks the ‘Start signing’ button and the pop-up box opens, they will just see an area where they can either choose Signature (with an electronically generated signature) or Draw or Upload (to draw or upload their signature):\nIf we choose No to Hide sign by textbox, when the user clicks Start signing they will see a ‘Sign by’ textbox at the top of the pop-up that appears:\n  Allow override sign by - Select Yes if you want to allow override of the signature inserted in the Signature field. If you choose Yes, an additional option will be shown - Default title of sign by:\nIf you select Yes to ‘Allow override sign by’ and then click into the ‘Default title of sign by’ field, you can then select a field to be used to populate the default name in the Signature field. For example, you could select a User picker field within your form as the ‘Default title of sign by’ - this would then mean that the user that is selected in that User picker field will be the default name shown in the Signature field.\n  Hide default signature tab - Select Yes if you want to hide the default signature tab (where an electronic signature is automatically generated). If you choose Yes, the next option - Auto save signature - will no longer be available to you.\nIn our example, if we select No to hiding the default signature tab, the user will see the electronically generated signature:\n  Auto save signature - Select Yes if you want to auto save the signature.\n  Button icon - You can choose an icon to appear on your Signature field button (or can opt not to have an icon on it). Click on the down arrow to the right of the field and select the icon you want from several hundred icons in the dropdown list.\n  Button color - Choose the colour you want for your Signature field button. The options are Navy, Green, Blue, Amber, Red or White.\n  Sign dialog button text - You can choose the text to appear on the button at the bottom right of the Signature dialog box. By default, the text is ‘OK’ but you can change this to whatever you want.\n  Once you complete the New field - Signature dialog box, click OK and the new Signature field will be added to your form.\nIn our example, if we insert a new Signature field titled ‘Manager Signature’, it will be added to the bottom of the Performance Plan form and look like this:\n  By default, the Title of the new Signature field will not be shown but you can change this by selecting the the field and checking the Show title checkbox in the Field properties menu to the right.\n  You can then click on the new Signature field within the form to see how it will appear to users.\nIn our case, we can click on the ‘Start Signing’ Manager Signature button to see the dialog box that will appear when the form user clicks on it:\nThe user can choose between a system-created Signature or to Draw or Upload their own version. If you click on Draw or Upload you can see how the user can either sign on the dotted line (and click on Clear at any stage to erase a mistake) or click on Upload handwritten signature and browse for a file.\nClick on the OK button to close the dialog box.\n  You may decide to add rules to your Signature field - to learn more about the different categories of rules available, go to Rules. The rules we add will be executed in the order in which they are listed under Rules in the right hand pane.\n  How to edit, move and delete Signature fields To edit a Signature field:\n  Select the Signature field (by either clicking on the field name or on the field’s drag handle button )\n  Click on the Edit Field button (Pen icon)   The Edit Field dialog box will open (with the Signature field title you chose reflected in the dialog box name), enabling you to choose from the same range of options as appear in the New field - Signature dialog box (as already discussed in How to get started).\n  To move a Signature field, simply:\n  Select the Signature field’s Drag handle button .\n  Drag and drop the Signature field wherever you want to move it within your form.\nFor example, we can move the ‘Employee Signature’ Signature field from where it was automatically added at the bottom of the panel to the location where we want it to go:\nIn our example, if we moved the two Signature fields we inserted in the Performance Plan form - one titled ‘Manager Signature’ and a second titled ‘Employee Signature’ - to go under the ‘For Manager’ and ‘For Employee’ sections, they could look like this:\n  To delete a Signature field from your form:\n Select the Signature field (by either clicking on the field’s title or its drag handle button ). Click on the Bin/Trash button . Click on OK to confirm.  How to view and edit Signature field properties To view or edit a Signature control’s Field properties:\n  Select the Signature field (by either clicking on the field title or drag handle button ).\n  The Field Properties associated with the Signature field will be displayed (and can be changed) in the Field properties menu to the right.\nFor example, the Field Properties associated with a Signature field titled ‘Manager Signature’ are shown here and include:\n Field type - The type of field, in this case a Signature field. Title - The Title of the field, in this case ‘Manager Signature’. Show title - If this is selected, the Signature field title will be shown in the form. Required - If this is selected, the Signature field will be mandatory for the form user. Enabled - If this is selected, the user will be able to edit or interact with the field. Visible - If this is selected, the Signature field will be visible in the form. Layout - The width of the blue bar can be adjusted to change the width of the Signature field as it appears on a PC or mobile phone (to view the Mobile layout, click on the expand button to the right).    ​\tFor more details, go to Field Properties.\nSaving changes and version history Make sure to save any changes you make by clicking on the Save button . You will always have the option to revert back to previous versions of your form by clicking the Design Version History button in the top right corner.\nWhat’s next  Now that you’ve learned about the Signature control, find out more about the other types of Action fields you can add to Kianda forms:\n  Button control\n  Image control\n  Link controls\n    ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"A Signature control can be used in a form to capture a user’s …","ref":"/platform/controls/actions/signature/","tags":"","title":"Signature control"},{"body":" Page under construction\n ","categories":"","description":"Learn how to store application data outside of Kianda","excerpt":"Learn how to store application data outside of Kianda","ref":"/how-to/storing-data-outside-kianda/","tags":"","title":"Storing form data outside Kianda"},{"body":"The Support function is available to users with a designated role, for example, Manage partners, Designer or Administrator and is found in the left-hand side pane, under More.
