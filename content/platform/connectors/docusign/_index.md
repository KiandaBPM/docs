One of the data connectors within Kianda that you can connect to is **DocuSign**. DocuSign enables organisations to manage electronic agreements by offering electronic signatures also know as **eSignatures**. eSignatures are a way to sign different types of documents electronically on many different devices.  

## When to use

You can use the DocuSign data connector when a process you have created requires you to send individual documents or envelopes to get them signed **electronically**. With the connector, you can access different types of **templates** that you have created within your DocuSign account, **download** documents, and access already existing envelopes to see their **status** or **summary**. 

## Before you get started

In advance of using the DocuSign data connector, you must have an account with DocuSign. This account is used to authorise a connection between your Kianda subscription and your DocuSign account itself, so that the DocuSign **Application Programming Interface (API)** can be used. There are two types of accounts that you can create in DocuSign. An **ordinary** account and a **developer** account. Take note which account you have created as this information will be used to create a different connection within Kianda.

## How to get started

1. From the Kianda home page, click on **Administration** > **Data sources**.

2. Click on **+ Add new** button ![Add new data connector button](/images/addnew.png) and choose **DocuSign** from the list of data sources provided.

3. You will be automatically brought to the **DocuSign details** page, where you can start setting up the connection.

   ![DocuSign details page](/images/docusign-details.jpg) 

   Choose from the edit options:

   - **Display name** - type in the name for your DocuSign connector. This is used to distinguish between different data connectors on your platform.
   - **DocuSign Environment** - indicates which environment you have your account created in. There are two types of accounts that you can create in DocuSign. A **developer** account and an **ordinary** account. If you have an ordinary account and you are trying to connect to DocuSign, you need to select the **Live** option, and if your account is a developer account, then select the **Demo** option. This is important as the authentication of the account is different for those two types of account.
     - **Demo** - indicates that your DocuSign account is a **developer** account.

     - **Live** - indicates that your DocuSign account is an **ordinary** account.

   - **Authorize** - allows you to **authorize** the connection with your DocuSign account and Kianda. When you click this button, a DocuSign window will open allowing you to log in into your DocuSign to **authenticate** your account.

4. When you have added File system details, you are ready to test your connection and add security. At the bottom of the **File system details** page, click on **Test connection** button ![Test connection for REST Service](/images/test-connection.jpg) and if the service has been correctly configured, then you should receive a notification saying **Connection test succeeded**.

5. Click on **Save** ![Save connection button](/images/save-connection.jpg) to save the connection and you will receive a notification saying **Details saved successfully**.

6. Add Security settings by clicking on the **Security** button, go to [Setting security for data sources](/platform/connectors/#setting-security-for-data-sources) for more details.

7. Click on **Close** to close the details page and return to the data source management main view.

## DocuSign functions

When you use the DocuSign data connector within Kianda, there are **default functions** that are invoked from DocuSign's API. These functions enable you to access a number of DocuSign's functionalities. You can use each DocuSign function by using the **Data** set of rules, to learn more about Data rules go to [Data rules](/platform/rules/data/). With each DocuSign function you use, data needs to be passed into the function know as **payload** and data is also returned, known as **response**. When using the Data rules, you are presented with **Input mapping** which is equivalent to the **payload**. This is used to pass data into the function, for example when you need a document signed, you need to pass in a document file to be signed, in other words, the document file you pass in is the **payload**. The **Results mapping** is equivalent to the **response**, this is used to populate your form fields when a DocuSign function returns data, for example **status** of an envelope.

Here is a list of all functions available when using the DocuSign data connector. To learn more about the **payload** and **response** for the available functions go to the [DocuSign API Reference](https://developers.docusign.com/esign-rest-api/reference/).

- **sendDocument** - allows you to send one or more documents to a recipient to get them signed.
- **sendEnvelope** - allows you to send a document to a recipient using one of your DocuSign templates.
- **listTemplates** - retrieves the **templateID** and **templateName** of all templates from your DocuSign account.
- **getEnvelope** - retrieves information from an envelope using an **envelopeID**.
- **getEnvelopeSummary** - retrieves a summary of an envelope using an **envelopeID**.
- **listEnvelopeDocuments** - retrieves any documents that are contained within an envelope using an **envelopeID**.
- **downloadDocument** - allows you to download a specific document using a **documentID** from an envelope using an **envelopeID**.
- **listTemplateSigners** - retrieves the name, role and **recipientID** of all signers from a template using a **templateID**.
- **getSigningUrl** - retrieves a URL to a signature made on an envelope using an **envelopeID**.

### Example use case of DocuSign function

Take the function **listTemplates** as an example. The **listTemplates** function **returns (response)** an **ID** and the **Name** of all templates that you have created in your DocuSign account. To use this function effectively, you can use the **Find items** rule in combination with the **table** input. The **Find items** rule will access all templates and map the results into the table. For each template in your DocuSign account, the **Find items** rule will add a table row with the appropriate **Template IDs** and **Template Names** of each template.

To showcase the functionality explained above, we will apply the **Find items** rule to a **button**; however, it can be applied to a form field, a form or a process (the rule will be executed when the process loads). Each time we press this button, a table will be populated with a list of **Template IDs** and **Template Names** from our DocuSign account.

1. Create a button in your process, to learn how to create a button go to [Button control](/platform/controls/actions/button/).

2. Create a table with two columns and call them **ID** and **Name**. To learn how to create a table and add columns go to [Table control](/platform/controls/input/table/).

3. Apply the **Find items** rule to the button by following the steps from [Find items rule](/platform/rules/data/find-items/). When following the steps of the **Find items** rule, make sure to do the following:

   - Select the **Map results to table** option and select the table you created. This way the **Find items** rule will create as many rows as there are templates in your DocuSign account. 
   - The **listTemplates** function does not require any **payload (Input mapping)**, so delete all fields from the **input mapping** section.
   - Select **listTemplates** as your data source from your DocuSign connector.
   - Select the appropriate column field from your table and results field from your data source in the **Results mapping** section.
