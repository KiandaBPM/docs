One of the datasources available in Kianda is a **MySQL Server** datasource. MySQL is a relational database management system (**RDBMS**) used to manage structured collections of data. This data can consist of anything from a simple to do list to a more complex organisation network. Using the MySQL server as your datasource, you can perform any Create, Read, Update and Delete (**CRUD**) operations using the **Data** rules provided in the Kianda platform, to learn more about data rules go to [Data rules](/platform/rules/data/). Using the MySQL server connector, you have access to all tables within your database from your server, keep in mind that you can perform CRUD operations on data within a **table** of the database, but you **cannot** create or delete **tables themselves**.

## When to use

You can use the MySQL Server connector when you want **access** or **modify** data within a **table** in your MySQL server. You can connect the MySQL server connector to a **List** field as its datasource, meaning you can access information from a table and display the information that is stored in the table. For example if your MySQL server contains tables such as **Employees**, **Purchases** and **Standing Orders**, you will be able to connect the list field to one of those tables giving you CRUD access to its data. 

Take a table **Employees** as an example, if this employee table contains data about the employees in your company such as name, phone number, email address and home address. You can **create** a new employee by providing necessary information, you can **read** (display) employee data, **update** employees information for example when a home address has changed and you can **delete** an employee from the table. Those are the CRUD operations you can perform on MySQL server through a process within Kianda. 

## Before getting started

When establishing a connection using MySQL data connector, you are creating a connection with a **Database** from a server, not the **server** itself. Before continuing make sure that your MySQL server has a **database** you can connect to. A database can represent any type of data you want to access, and within this database, you need to create a **table** representing the actual data you will have CRUD access to. For example creating a database of your company name such as **GreenITR**, and within this database you can create tables to represent your **Employees**, **Purchases** and **Standing Orders**.

## How to get started

1. From the Kianda home page, click on **Administration** > **Data sources**.

2. Click on **+ Add new** button ![Add new data connector button](/images/addnew.png) and choose **MySQL** from the list of datasources provided.

3. Fill out fields in the **MySQL Server details** screen.

   ![SQL Server details page](/images/mysql-details.jpg)

   Choose from the edit options:

   - **Display name** - type in the name for your MySQL server connector. This is used to distinguish between different data connectors on your platform.
   - **Server** - the name of the server you want to access or the IP address where the server is hosted. When you are running a local server on your machine you can use `localhost` as the server name. If you are connecting to a public server, enter in the name of the server.
   - **Database** - the name of the database from your server that you want to connect to.
   - **User** - username used to log into the server. 
   - **Password** - password used to log into the server.
   - **Use Kianda Cloud Connect** - by default this option is disabled, the cloud connect is used to **create a connection** between a **locally run MySQL server** and **Kianda** itself. To learn more about **Kianda Cloud Connect** and how to create a connection between Kianda and your PC, go to [Kianda Cloud Connect](/platform/connectors/kianda-cloud-connect/). Check this option if you want to connect to a server that is running on your local machine. When **Use Kianda Cloud Connect** is enabled, a **Connectors** option appears.
     - **Connectors** - displays all available connector PC's that have a **connection established** with your **Kianda** subscription. This option is used to select the PC **connection** that **runs** the **local MySQL server** that you want to connect to.
   - **Status** - represents the current status of the connection.
     - **incomplete** - means that the details of the connector were not fully completed
     - **test failed** - means that the details of the connector are incorrect and the connection has failed.
     - **ready** - means that the connector has successfully connected and its ready to be used.

4. When you have added the MySQL server details, you are ready to test your connection and add security. At the bottom of the **MySQL Server details** page, click on **Test connection** button ![Test connection for REST Service](/images/test-connection.jpg) and if the service has been correctly configured, then you should receive a notification saying **Connection test succeeded**.

5. Click on **Save** ![Save connection button](/images/save-connection.jpg) to save the connection and you will receive a notification saying **Details saved successfully**.

6. Add Security settings by clicking on the **Security** button, go to [Setting security for data sources](/platform/connectors/#setting-security-for-data-sources) for more details.

7. Click on **Close** to close the details page and return to the data source management main view.

## Whatâ€™s next ![Idea icon](/images/18.png)

Your **MySQL Server connector** is now set up and ready to be used in your **processes**. To find out more about how to design processes go to [Designer](/platform/application-designer/designer/).
