---

One of the data connectors within Kianda that you can connect to is **Active Directory** (**AD**) also known as **Active Directory Domain Services** (**AD DS**). AD is a logical and hierarchical structured data store of objects which are mostly accounts. Accounts such as **Users, Computers, Groups** and other objects such as **Printers** or **Group Policy Objects** (GPO). For example, you can store information about user accounts within an AD such as **Name, Email, Manager name, Password, Job title** and **Permissions**. 

The Kianda AD connector uses Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (**LDAP**) allowing users to query Active Directory libraries for example to retrieve properties for users. For more information on LDAP go to https://ldap.com/ or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol.

## When to use

Having an AD connector will allow you to access and update information that is stored in your AD database from your Kianda subscription. You will be able to use **User-related** AD functions which will allow you to use the connector when manipulating users within your AD. For example creating users, updating their permissions, moving them between groups or removing them from the directory. To use the AD functions, you can use the [Data](/platform/rules/data/) rules that are predefined within Kianda.



## Before you get started

Before you can create a connection with your Active Directory and your Kianda subscription, you need to 

a) download **Kianda Cloud Connect**

b) create a **specific user for the connector**, defined in your Active directory database

#### Kianda Cloud Connect
**Kianda Cloud Connect** is a piece of software that **establishes a connection** between your **local machine** and your **Kianda subscription**. This lightweight app will **sit on your PC or server** where files reside that you need to use in Kianda processes, and therefore is an **on premise** function . 

Kianda Cloud Connect allows data to **travel** from your local machine to the Kianda Cloud Connect service, and then the Kianda Cloud Connect service sends data to your Kianda subscription. This data transfer works both ways depending on what operation you are performing for example **Deleting** a file or **Creating** one. 

#### User account for the connection

You must create an **account in your AD service** which will serve as the connector administration account for the data connector, and this account must be a global administrator in order to allow access to functions. 

this account must correspond. Note that this account can only be used to manage the connector for one subscription and **cannot** be used in **more than one Kianda subscriptions** as Kianda Cloud Connect will not be able to tell which subscription you want to connect to.


To learn more about how to download and create a connection between your Kianda subscription and Kianda Cloud Connect go to [Kianda Cloud Connect](/platform/connectors/kianda-cloud-connect/).



## How to get started

1. From the Kianda home page, click on **Administration** > **Data sources**.

2. Click on **+ Add new** button ![Add new data connector button](/images/addnew.png) and choose **Active Directory** from the list of data sources provided.

3. You will be automatically brought to the **Active Directory details** page, where you can start setting up the connection. 

   ![File system detail page](/images/ad-details.jpg)

   Choose from the edit options:

   - **Display name** - type in the name for your PowerShell connector. The display name is used to identify your connector.
   - **Directory path** - enter in the path to the directory. The path must be **LDAP or GC** (Global Connector).
   - **AD User** - enter in the domain and user that you want to connect to. To specify the domain and user correctly use the following format: `<domain>/<username>`
   - **Password** - enter in the password used to login for the desired user.
   - **Use Kianda Cloud Connect** - by default this option is enabled, the cloud connect is used to **create a connection** between the **Active Directory connector** and **Kianda** itself. To learn more about **Kianda Cloud Connect** and how to create a connection between Kianda and your PC, go to [Kianda Cloud Connect](/platform/connectors/kianda-cloud-connect/). 
     - **Connectors** - displays all available connector PC's that have a **connection established** with your **Kianda** subscription. This option is used to select the PC **connection** that is running the Active Directory server.
   - **Status** - represents the current status of the connection.
     - **incomplete** - means that the details of the connector were not fully completed.
     - **test failed** - means that the details of the connector are incorrect and the connection has failed.
     - **ready** - means that the connector has successfully connected and its ready to be used.

   Here is an example of a completed AD connector page, where the directory path is LDAP and this connector is connecting to  LAB2 where the AD database resides.

4. When you have added the necessary details, you are ready to test your connection and add security. At the bottom of the **PowerShell Connector** page, click on **Test connection** button ![Test connection for REST Service](/images/test-connection.jpg) and if the service has been correctly configured, then you should receive a notification saying **Connection test succeeded**.

5. Click on **Save** ![Save connection button](/images/save-connection.jpg) to save the connection and you will receive a notification saying **Details saved successfully**.

6. Add Security settings by clicking on the **Security** button, go to [Setting security for data sources](/platform/connectors/#setting-security-for-data-sources) for more details.

7. Click on **Close** to close the details page and return to the data source management main view.

   

## Active Directory Remote Procedures

Active Directory functions are **User-related** **remote procedures** and to use them you have to use the [Data](/platform/rules/data/) rules that are predefined within Kianda. The remote procedures that are available are listed below. To give you an idea of how they work, some of these procedures are detailed on other pages, click on the links below to find out more.

![Active Directory list of functions](/images/ad-functions.jpg)

- [**FindUsers**](/platform/connectors/active-directory/find-users) - allows you to look for a user within your directory by defining a user attribute as a means of searching for them.
- **IsMemberOf** - allows you to see if a user is a member of a group. You need to specify both a user and a group.
- **CreateUser** - allows you to create a user within your directory. You need to specify a **username**, **first name, last name, email and password** to create a user successfully.
- **UpdateUser** - allows you to update user attributes. You need to specify what user to update by providing their **sAMAccountName** and **distinguishedName** (DN).
- **AddUserToGroup** - allows you to add a user to a group by providing the group name and both the **distinguishedName** and **sAMAccountName** of the user.
- **RemoveUserFromGroup** - allows you to remove a user from a group by providing the group name and both the **distinguishedName** and **sAMAccountName** of the user.
- **Enable User** - allows you to enable or disable a user by providing the enable parameter and both the **distinguishedName** and **sAMAccountName** of the user. The enable parameter is either **true** or **false**.
- **MoveUser** - allows you to move a user to a specific path in your directory by providing the destination path and both the **distinguishedName** and **sAMAccountName** of the user.

### Create User Function example
Lets take the **CreateUser** function as an example to show how these functions work. As mentioned earlier, we need to use the Data rules to use these functions and for this example we use the **Create item** rule which is available from the Data rules. 

1. When creating a user in Active Directory, there are some required properties that we need to provide. Those properties are a **username**, **givenName** (first name), **surname** (last name), **email** and **password**. There are also extra properties that can be provided by expanding a properties tab within the function:

   ![Active Directory list of functions](/images/ad-create-user.jpg)

2. We need to create at least five fields that will be used to provide a value as the required properties. We will use a [text box field](/platform/controls/input/textbox/) for each one:

   ![Required fields for the required properties](/images/ad-fields.jpg)

3. Use the [create item](/platform/rules/data/create-item/) rule to use the function. We need to map the text box fields to the appropriate properties as follow:

   ![Mapping the required fields to create item rule](/images/ad-create-user-rule.jpg)

You can apply the create item rule to a button, for example, the submit button. This will result in a user being created in your AD whenever the submit button will be clicked.

### AD Use case example - User synchronisation

Using AD you can perform user synchronisation for user groups in Kianda. For example by creating a specific group in Kianda, we can allow Group member synchronisation for that group, by choosing the option shown in the image below with, using the AD data connector. See [Groups](/platform/administration/users/#groups) for more details on group creation. 

![Group member sync](/images/group-member-sync.jpg)

In the example above, the Kianda environment is synchronised with AD, so that any users added to or deleted from the AD database will be added to or removed from the users of the group 'Company Users'. This kind of **user synchronisation** is also possible with [Office 365](/platform/connectors/office-365/), [SharePoint](/platform/connectors/sharepoint/) as well as AD.

By clicking on the Filter button <img src="/images/filter-button.jpg" alt="Filter button" style="zoom:80%;" />within Groups, an **LDAP Filter** can be applied. The LDAP filter is an open format that allows you to perform queries with AD. For example the query below is used to query for users in the IT department with an account that is not disabled (=2).
