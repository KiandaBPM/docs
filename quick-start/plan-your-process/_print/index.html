<h2 id=3-creating-and-managing-rules>3. Creating and Managing Rules</h2><p>Creating and managing rules in Kianda is a straightforward process that allows you to implement complex logic and dynamic behaviors in your process applications. This section will guide you through the steps of adding rules to controls, managing form submission rules, and configuring process load rules.</p><h4 id=adding-rules-to-controls>Adding Rules to Controls</h4><p>Adding rules to controls is a fundamental aspect of creating dynamic forms in Kianda. Controls, such as text boxes, dropdown lists, and buttons, can have rules attached to them to define their behavior based on user interactions. Here’s how you can add rules to controls:</p><ol>
<li><strong>Select the Control</strong>: Navigate to the form designer and select the control you want to add a rule to.</li><li><strong>Add the rule</strong>: In the left panel, find the and click on &ldquo;Add a rule&rdquo; to expand the section.</li><li><strong>Choose the Rule Type</strong>: Select the type of rule you want to add from the list of available rules. For example, you might choose a &ldquo;Hide or Disable&rdquo; rule to conditionally hide a control based on user input.</li><li><strong>Define Rule Conditions</strong>: Set the conditions that trigger the rule. Conditions can be based on field values, user properties, dates, and more. You can add multiple conditions and condition groups to create complex logic.</li><li><strong>Configure the Rule Action</strong>: Specify the action that should occur when the conditions are met. For example, if the rule is to hide a control, you will specify which control to hide.</li><li><strong>Save the Rule</strong>: Once you’ve configured the rule, click ok to apply the logic to the control.</li></ol><h4 id=form-submission-rules>Form Submission Rules</h4><p>Form submission rules are executed when a form is submitted and marked as completed using the &ldquo;Submit Form&rdquo; rule. These rules are crucial for performing final validations, calculations, or data operations before the form is finalized. To add submission rules:</p><ol>
<li><strong>Access Form Rules</strong>: In the form designer, click on the form tab on the top to reveal the &ldquo;Form submit rules&rdquo; section under the properties panel.</li><li><strong>Add a Form Submission Rule</strong>: On the left panel click on &ldquo;Add a rule&rdquo; to expand the rules section. Rules added here should be executed upon form submission. For example, you might add a &ldquo;Send Email&rdquo; rule to notify a supervisor that the form has been completed.</li><li><strong>Define Rule Conditions</strong>: Similar to control rules, define any conditions that need to be met for these rules to execute. This ensures that the rules are only triggered under the appropriate circumstances.</li><li><strong>Save and Test</strong>: Save the rules and test the form submission to ensure that all logic is executed as expected.</li></ol><p>The &ldquo;Submit Form Rule&rdquo; rules can be added to a submit button to initiate the submit form event.</p><h4 id=process-onload-rules>Process OnLoad Rules</h4><p>Process load rules are executed when a process is loaded. These rules are useful for pre-loading data, initializing form fields, or performing any setup operations required when the users opens the process. Here’s how to configure process load rules:</p><ol>
<li><strong>Open On Load Rules</strong>: In the process designer, click the title of the process on the top bar above the save button". This will reveal the &ldquo;On load rules&rdquo; on the properties panel on the right.</li><li><strong>Add Onload Rules</strong>: Select &ldquo;Add a rule&rdquo; under left panel to expand the rules section. Choose the type of rule you want to execute when the process loads, such as &ldquo;Find Items&rdquo; to pre-load data into the form.</li><li><strong>Define Conditions and Actions</strong>: Set the conditions that trigger the rule and specify the actions to be performed. For example, you might set a condition to check if certain data is available before populating the form fields.</li><li><strong>Test the Process Load</strong>: Save the rules and load the process to verify that the onload rules execute correctly and the form is initialized as intended.</li></ol><p>By mastering the creation and management of rules in Kianda, you can build highly dynamic and responsive process applications. These rules allow you to automate tasks, enforce business logic, and create user-friendly forms that adapt to various inputs and conditions, ultimately enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of your workflows.</p><video class=inline-video-player loading=lazy muted loop playsinline autoplay poster>

<h2 id=4-rule-conditions>4. Rule Conditions</h2><p>Rule conditions in Kianda provide the logical framework that determines when a rule will execute. These conditions are essential for implementing dynamic behaviors in your process applications, ensuring that actions are only taken when specific criteria are met. Understanding how to configure and use rule conditions is crucial for building robust and responsive process apps.</p><h4 id=overview-of-rule-conditions>Overview of Rule Conditions</h4><p>Rule conditions are the building blocks of logic within Kianda rules. They define the &ldquo;if-then&rdquo; scenarios that control the execution of actions in your process apps. Each rule can have an unlimited number of conditions, allowing you to create complex and nuanced logic. Conditions can be based on various factors, such as field values, dates, user properties, and more.</p><h4 id=condition-groups-and-conditions>Condition Groups and Conditions</h4><p>Rule conditions are composed of condition groups and individual conditions:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Condition Groups</strong>: These act like parentheses in logical expressions, grouping multiple conditions together. You can define whether all conditions within a group must be met (AND logic) or if meeting any one condition is sufficient (OR logic).</li><li><strong>Individual Conditions</strong>: Each condition represents a specific logical test, such as checking if a field equals a certain value or if a date falls within a specified range. These conditions form the criteria that must be evaluated to determine whether a rule should execute.</li></ul><p>The <strong>conditions visual editor</strong> provides a visual editor in the process designer that enables developers easily author conditions for use in many logical scenarios.</p><p><img src=/images/editconditions.gif alt="Conditions editor"></p><p>Here is an example JSON representation of rule conditions:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-json data-lang=json><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#4e9a06>&#34;condition-groups&#34;</span><span style=color:#a40000>:</span> <span style=color:#000;font-weight:700>[{</span>
