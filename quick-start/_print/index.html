<h2 id=3-understanding-controls>3. Understanding Controls</h2><p>In Kianda, controls are the building blocks of your forms. They allow you to capture user inputs, organize the layout, perform actions, and even create custom functionality.</p><p>Controls are grouped into four main categories: Input, Layout, Actions, and Custom. Each category serves a distinct purpose, helping you create interactive and responsive forms tailored to your business needs. The table below lists the controls available under each category.</p><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>Input Controls</strong></th><th><strong>Layout Controls</strong></th><th><strong>Action Controls</strong></th><th><strong>Custom Controls</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td>Text Box</td><td>Panel</td><td>Button</td><td>Custom controls created using HTML, Handlebars, and JavaScript</td></tr><tr>
<td>List (Dropdown, Radio Button, Multi-select, Checkbox)</td><td>Dialog Box</td><td>Link</td><td></td></tr><tr>
<td>Number</td><td>Rich Text</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr>
<td>Date</td><td>Field Group</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr>

<td>Toggle</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr>
<td>Signature Pad</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id=4-adding-controls-to-a-form>4. Adding Controls to a Form</h2><p>Adding controls to a form in Kianda is a straightforward process. Once you have accessed the form builder, you can drag and drop the desired controls from the control panel onto your form canvas.</p><p>Each control can be customized through its properties, which are displayed on the right side of the screen. You can configure settings such as visibility, required fields, responsiveness, and more. This intuitive interface allows you to quickly build and modify forms to suit your specific needs, ensuring an efficient and user-friendly experience for end-users.</p><video class=inline-video-player loading=lazy muted loop playsinline autoplay poster>

<h2 id=5-making-forms-mobile-responsive>5. Making Forms Mobile Responsive</h2><p>Ensuring that your forms are mobile responsive is essential for providing a seamless user experience across different devices. Kianda&rsquo;s form builder allows you to design forms that automatically adjust to various screen sizes, from desktops to tablets and smartphones. Using the responsive layout options available in the form builder, you can define how each control should behave on different devices. This ensures that your forms remain accessible and user-friendly, regardless of the screen size.</p><p>To make a form mobile responsive, start by configuring the layout settings of each control. In the properties panel, you can specify the number of columns a control should span on different screen sizes, following the Bootstrap grid system.</p><p>For example, you might set a text box to take up half the width of the screen on a desktop (6 columns) but adjust it to full width (12 columns) on a mobile device. This flexibility allows you to optimize the layout for better readability and ease of use on smaller screens.</p><p>Additionally, you can group controls using layout elements like panels and field groups to maintain a clean and organized structure. These grouping elements can also be configured for responsiveness, ensuring that related controls stay together and display cohesively on all devices. By leveraging Kianda&rsquo;s responsive design features, you can create forms that provide a consistent and efficient user experience, enhancing usability and satisfaction for both desktop and mobile users.</p><h2 id=6-advanced-control-configuration>6. Advanced Control Configuration</h2><p>Advanced Control Configuration in the form builder allows you to tailor each control to meet specific requirements.

<h2 id=3-integrating-data-sources-with-process-apps>3. Integrating Data Sources with Process Apps</h2><p>Integrating data sources with your process apps in Kianda allows you to dynamically read and display data from external databases directly within your forms.</p><p>There are two primary methods to achieve this: using the List control for direct binding to data sources and utilizing the Find Items rule. These tools enable you to create forms that interact seamlessly with your data sources, providing real-time access to essential data.</p><p>The List control in Kianda can be directly bound to a data source, making it a powerful tool for displaying data within your forms. When configuring the List control, you can select the desired data source using the data source picker.</p><p>Once selected, additional fields are provided to fine-tune the data binding. The Display field specifies the column from the data source that will be shown to users as the display value, while the Value field determines the column that will hold the actual value.</p><p>This setup is particularly useful for dropdown lists, radio buttons, multi-select options, and checkbox lists, allowing you to populate these controls with data directly from your databases without requiring additional coding.</p><p>By leveraging the List control and the Find Items rule, you can effectively integrate data sources with your Kianda process apps, providing a dynamic and interactive experience for users.</p><p>These tools enable you to seamlessly read data from external databases, enhancing the functionality and usability of your forms. In the next section, we will explore how to configure and utilize these controls and rules in detail, ensuring you can implement these integrations smoothly and efficiently.</p><h3 id=31-list-control-data-binding>3.1.

<h3 id=33-saving-form-inputs-to-data-sources>3.3. Saving Form Inputs to Data Sources</h3><p>Writing data to data sources in Kianda is a crucial functionality that allows users to take input from forms and persist it into various external systems.</p><p>This can be achieved using the Create Item rule, Update Item rule, and Delete Item rule, which together with the Find Items rule, provide full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.</p><p>These rules are not limited to databases but can also be applied to non-database data sources such as REST APIs or third-party services, making them extremely versatile for various integration needs.</p><p>The Create Item rule is used to insert new records into a data source based on user input from a form. This rule supports the creation of one item at a time and, when working with databases, it translates into an INSERT statement.</p><p>The rule employs a visual transactional logic represented by three panels: Input Mapping, Success Mapping, and Error Mapping. These panels allow you to define what data should be sent to the data source, how to handle successful transactions, and how to manage errors.</p><p>This conditional logic enables complex workflows where subsequent actions can be triggered based on the success or failure of the initial data write operation.</p><p>Similarly, the Update Item rule is used to modify existing records in a data source. It can update multiple items in a single operation, which corresponds to an UPDATE statement in database terms.</p><p>This rule includes a flag to automatically ignore blank values, ensuring that only specified fields are updated. Like the Create Item rule, the Update Item rule uses the same transactional logic with Input Mapping, Success Mapping, and Error Mapping panels.</p><p>This allows developers to conditionally execute additional logic based on the outcome of the update operation.</p><p>The Delete Item rule completes the set of CRUD operations by allowing the removal of records from a data source. Together, these rules provide a robust framework for interacting with external data sources, enabling dynamic and responsive process applications.</p><p>By combining these data rules with the Find Items rule, Kianda users can create comprehensive data management workflows within their forms. For example, a process could begin with a Find Items rule to retrieve existing records, followed by an Update Item rule to modify those records, or a Create Item rule to add new records based on user input.</p><p>This seamless integration of reading and writing data ensures that Kianda forms can handle complex business scenarios, making your process applications both powerful and flexible.</p><h2 id=4-best-practices>4. Best Practices</h2><p>Implementing best practices when integrating and managing data sources in Kianda ensures that your process applications are secure, efficient, and maintainable. Here are some key recommendations to follow:</p><h3 id=performance-optimization>Performance Optimization</h3><p>Optimizing the performance of your data interactions is crucial for maintaining responsive and efficient applications. When designing forms, use server-side filtering and pagination to manage large datasets effectively, avoiding the need to load extensive data sets into the client-side.</p><p>For frequent data interactions, enable caching where appropriate to reduce the load on your data sources and improve response times.</p><p>Additionally, optimize your queries and rules to retrieve only the necessary data, and use indexed columns in your databases to speed up search operations.</p><p>Kianda automatically performs server side paging and filtering under the hood to ensure that the application is fast and responsive to users.</p><h3 id=security-considerations>Security Considerations</h3><p>Securing your data connections is paramount. Restrict access to data sources based on the principle of least privilege, ensuring that only authorized users and services can read or write data.</p><p>Utilize Kianda’s security features, such as data source security, enabling security settings for panels and buttons, to further control access and actions within your forms.</p><h3 id=managing-data-source-changes>Managing Data Source Changes</h3><p>Change management is an essential aspect of maintaining data source integrations. Document your data source configurations and changes meticulously.</p><p>Before making changes to live data sources, test them thoroughly in a development or staging environment to ensure they do not disrupt existing processes. Implement fallback mechanisms and error handling in your forms to manage unexpected issues gracefully.</p><p>Regularly review and audit your data source configurations to ensure they remain aligned with your organizational policies and performance standards.</p><h2 id=5-data-source-connectors-in-kianda>5.
