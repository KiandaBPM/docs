<h2 id=introduction>Introduction</h2><p>Processes in Kianda are made up of <strong>forms</strong>. Forms contain all the buttons, fields, and rule triggers needed to execute your process.</p><p>You can use the <strong>Designer</strong> to design <strong>forms</strong> for <strong>end users</strong> who will use the platform to submit, save and review information, either as named users in the platform, users who receive a link to an anonymous form, or partners who can access shared processes. These end users will create new <strong>process instances</strong> or records in the system, or access <strong>existing process instances</strong> which shows information that has either been <strong>saved or submitted</strong> in a form.</p><p>When discussing forms we&rsquo;ll talk about <strong>form design</strong> that is creating and updating forms within a process using Kianda <strong>Designer</strong> as well <strong>form use</strong> which refers to end users who will edit or read forms in a process instance/record in the system, built using the <strong>Designer</strong>.</p><h2 id=form-design-principles>Form design principles</h2><p>As you work with Kianda <strong>Designer</strong> you are designing the &lsquo;user interface&rsquo; for users to interact with a particular process. Keeping the end user in mind, there are three design principles:</p><ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Reading modes</strong>: <strong>Form users</strong> can either use/access forms in <strong>edit</strong> mode or <strong>read</strong> mode. Edit mode means that users can submit information, while read mode means that users can only view forms. The latter may be useful for example for certain staff to review customer feedback in a form, but not be able to change/edit the feedback form.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Current form</strong>: Typically there are several forms in a process, and by default the <strong>first form</strong> in a process is the <strong>current form</strong>.</p><p><img src=/images/3-form-example.jpg alt="Three form process example"></p><p>For example in the Training Attendance Process above, the process flow is as follows:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Training Request</strong> - an employee initiates a process instance by filling out this form</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Training Approval</strong> - the manager approves the request using this form</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Training Attendance</strong> - when training approval occurs, a trainer invites the employee to attend training and once complete, the trainer completes a this form to evaluate the employee&rsquo;s participation.</p><p>Therefore when a process instance is initiated upon submission of the <strong>Training Request</strong> form, then the next form in the process becomes the <strong>current form</strong>, in this case the <strong>Training Approval</strong> form.</p><p>Only the form that has the status ‘<strong>current form’</strong> <strong>is editable</strong> by a form owner (see point 3 below). In a complex multi-step process, several forms can be configured to <strong>activate with</strong> the current form, meaning they are also editable at the same time, creating a <strong>form group</strong>, see section 2 of <a href=#new-form-creation>New form creation</a>. Rules can also be used to change the workflow and make other forms the &lsquo;current form&rsquo;.</p><p>Also note that <strong>all first forms</strong> in a process flow add the current user as a &lsquo;form owner&rsquo; therefore allowing <strong>all users</strong> to edit the first form, as clicking on &lsquo;submit&rsquo; or &lsquo;save&rsquo; in the first form results in a new process instance.</p></li></ul></li><li>
<p><strong>Form owner</strong>: The <strong>default owner</strong> is the person or group that the form is assigned to, this means they can <strong>edit the <u>current</u> form(s) in a process instance</strong>. Default owners are typically set when a form is created, see section 1 of <a href=#new-form-creation>New form creation</a> below. By default, <strong>only this person or group can edit the <u>current</u> form</strong> in a process instance. All other users can only view forms in read mode. The default owner however can reassign forms to other individuals and/or groups. Form ownership can also be assigned dynamically using the <a href=/platform/rules/workflow/assign-form/>Assign form</a> rule.</p></li></ol><p>These three considerations are established when the form is created, as seen in the dialog box below, and these parameters can be updated at any time by editing the form design. These properties can also change <strong>dynamically</strong> as a result of <strong>implementing rules</strong>, for example the <a href=/platform/rules/workflow/go-to-form/>Go to form</a> rule can change the workflow in a process.</p><h3 id=new-form-creation>New form creation</h3><p>As mentioned above there are certain considerations to keep in mind when working with forms. The image below shows a <strong>New form</strong> dialog box that is created when the <strong>Add form</strong> button is clicked in Kianda Designer. At any time if you click on a form and then the <strong>Edit/pen</strong> button <img src=/images/penicon.png alt="Edit/pen button"> an <strong>Edit form</strong> dialog box appears which has the same parameters as the one shown in the image below.</p><p><em><strong>New form dialog box</strong></em></p><p><img src=https://academy.kianda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/newformsegments-1.gif alt=img></p><h5 id=new-form-considerations>New form considerations</h5><ol>
<li>The <strong>Default owner(s)</strong> field is where you can set individuals and groups as the default <strong>form owners</strong> who can edit the form.</li><li><strong>Activate with</strong> means that the form can be activated with other forms within the process, so they can be edited at the same time. This means several forms become the <strong>current form</strong> in a form group.</li><li><strong>Submit mode</strong> means that when a process instance is running you can choose <strong>only this form</strong> to be submitted, or you can choose <strong>all forms in edit mode</strong> meaning that several forms could have their details submitted or saved.</li><li><strong>Enable quick actions</strong> allows you to <strong>statically</strong> enable a) reassignment, b) edit, and c) custom actions on any form. For a) and b) you can choose individuals and/or groups who can reassign or edit forms. In the case of b) edit there are options to <strong>hide form footer buttons</strong> when editing, and to <strong>trigger rules on save</strong> against a set field when saving edits. For c) custom actions, you can set your own custom action and create an action label against a particular form field. This means that the user(s) assigning the custom action will see the labelled action designated for them. As a designer you can choose the <strong>action display mode</strong> as read-only, edit or both, so you can decide what type of access the user(s) will have.</li></ol><h2 id=related-rules>Related rules</h2><p>The following are rules that are directly associated with working with forms and form state.</p><ol>
<li><strong>Go to form</strong>: This rule enables the designer to provide a way for users navigate to any form within the process.</li><li><strong>Assign form</strong>: This rule allows designers to dynamically change the default form owners of forms from user picker fields or other means.</li><li><strong>Submit form</strong>: This rule marks the form as complete or submited and allows the process to progress the workflow to the next available form.</li><li><strong>Field display mode</strong>: This rule forces the form display mode to be editable or read only even when the current user is not a form owner.</li></ol></div></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always>
<h1 id=pg-4d38f94b362ed301e62446b48ac0457a>1 - Form owners</h1><p>When creating forms, it is important to consider <strong>form access</strong> during the design phase, that is who can access and edit forms <strong>in a process instance</strong>. For example if an employee submits a performance review form, a line manager may wish to access that submitted process instance/record and edit the form, adding in comments and performance grades.</p><p>There are two key principles to keep in mind in terms of <strong>form access</strong>:</p><ol>
<li>
<p>Forms are <strong>assignable</strong> - this means that forms can be assigned to individuals and/or groups, and then only they can <strong>edit</strong> the form, when it is the current form, in a process instance. The &lsquo;assignee&rsquo; can be a combination of users and groups. There are various ways a form can be assigned to a user:</p><p>​ a) Using <strong>Rules</strong>, in particular the Workflow rule <strong>Assign form</strong>, see <a href=/platform/rules/workflow/assign-form/>Assign form</a> for details</p><p>​ b) Using <strong>Quick actions</strong>, see <a href=/platform/application-designer/forms/form-quick-action/>Form Quick action</a> for details</p><p>​ c) Creating <strong>form owners</strong> when creating or updating a process design, see <a href=#creating-form-owners>Creating form owners</a> for details</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Only form owners</strong> can edit a given form when it is a <strong>current form</strong> in a process flow by <strong>default</strong>. Any other user with access to view the form will see it in read-only mode.</p></li></ol><p>So what is <strong>form owner</strong>? A form owner is assigned when a form is created in Kianda <strong>Designer</strong>. Form owners can also be added to a form design at a later stage by editing the form. Only the form owner will be able to <strong>edit current forms</strong> in <strong>process instances</strong> (records), see below.</p><h2 id=changing-form-access>Changing form access</h2><p>The <strong>default owner</strong> is the person or group that the form is assigned to using the <strong>default owner field</strong> in the <strong>new form</strong> dialog box as shown above. By default, only this person or group <strong>can edit the current form</strong> in a process instance. All other users can only view forms in read mode. The next section details how to <a href=#changing-default-owners>Change default owners</a>.</p><p>It is also possible to allow other users to have edit access to forms using the <a href=/platform/rules/workflow/assign-form/>Assign rule</a> and <a href=/platform/application-designer/forms/form-quick-action/>Quick actions</a>.</p><h3 id=changing-default-owners>Changing default owners</h3><ol>
<li>
<p>Using your <strong>Administration</strong> or <strong>Design business process</strong> role, go to <strong>Administration</strong> > <strong>Designer</strong> > select a process > select a form in the process.</p></li><li>
<p>Click on the form so the <strong>Edit/Pen</strong> button appears in the form name.</p><p><img src=/images/select-form-to-edit.jpg alt="Select form to edit"></p></li><li>
<p>Then click on the <strong>Edit/Pen</strong> button itself to edit the form.</p></li><li>
<p>An <strong>Edit form</strong> dialog box opens which has the same layout as the <strong>New form</strong> dialog box seen in <a href=#creating-form-owners>Creating form owners</a> above.</p><p><img src=/images/edit-form-dialog-box.jpg alt="Edit form dialog box"></p></li><li>
<p>Here you can change the default owner choosing from <strong>Users</strong>, <strong>Groups</strong> as before.</p></li></ol></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always>
<h1 id=pg-88ff85030afe7df99a1c39216553b8cd>2 - Form display modes</h1><p>Remember there are three principles to consider when working with forms:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Display mode</strong>: <strong>Form users</strong> can either use forms in <strong>edit</strong> mode or <strong>read</strong> mode. Edit mode means that users can submit information, while read mode means that users can only view forms. The latter may be useful for example for certain staff to review feedback in a form, but not be able to edit/update it.</li><li><strong>Form owner</strong>: The <strong>default owner</strong> is the person or group that the form is assigned to <strong>when the the form is created</strong>. By default, only this person or group <strong>can edit the current form</strong>. All other users can only view forms in read mode. The default owner however can reassign forms to other individuals and/or groups.</li><li><strong>Current form</strong>: Typically there are several forms in a process, and only the form that has the status ‘<strong>current form’</strong> is <strong>editable</strong>. However, in a complex multi-step process, other forms can be configured to <strong>activate with</strong> the current form, meaning they can also become editable at the same time, creating a form group.</li></ul><p>These three considerations are established when the form is created, as seen in the dialog box below.</p><p><em><strong>New form dialog box</strong></em></p><p><img src=/images/newformsegments-1.gif alt="New form dialog box"></p><p>These properties can also change <strong>dynamically</strong> as a result of <strong>rules being applied</strong>, see <a href=/platform/rules/>Rules</a>.</p><h3 id=setting-display-modes-statically>Setting display modes statically</h3><p>Remember forms in process instances are either in <strong>edit mode</strong> meaning they can be edited/changed or <strong>read mode</strong> where the details are visible to form users but cannot be changed. The actions below refer to making forms <strong>editable</strong> so if the actions below are not used, then the forms are in <strong>read mode</strong>. The actions below refer to static or fixed use, set when the form is first created or updated at a later time.</p><ol>
<li>
<p>Forms in process instances will be <strong>editable</strong> for <strong>Default owner(s)</strong>, that is the <strong>form owners</strong> defined when the form is created, or a form is edited. Form owners are defined in the <strong>New form/Edit form</strong> dialog box, shown in part 1 of the image above. When a process instance runs, the form owner can then edit the form in that instance.</p></li><li>
<p>By default the <strong>first form</strong> in a process becomes the <strong>current form</strong>, so only this form will be <strong>editable</strong>. However if several forms are <strong>activated with</strong> the current form when the form is created or edited in the <strong>New form/Edit form</strong> dialog box shown above, then <strong>all forms in that group</strong> will be editable by the form owner in a process instance.</p></li><li>
<p>By default the <strong>Submit mode</strong> for forms is <strong>Only this form</strong> meaning that when a process instance is running you can choose <u>only</u> that particular form can have details submitted or saved. Alternatively you can choose <strong>all forms in edit mode</strong>, meaning that several forms can have their details submitted or saved. For example if several forms are activated together and all are in <strong>edit mode</strong> then the details of all these forms can be submitted together in the database.</p></li><li>
<p>Forms can be statically set to allow <strong>Quick actions</strong> including allowing <strong>editing</strong>. When a form is created or edited using the <strong>New form/Edit form</strong> dialog box, clicking on <strong>Enable quick actions</strong> allows you to <strong>statically</strong> enable:</p><p>a) <strong>reassignment</strong> of forms</p><p>b) <strong>editing</strong> of forms</p><p>c) <strong>custom actions</strong> on any form</p><p>For a) and b) you can choose individuals and/or groups who can reassign or edit forms. In the case of b) edit there are options to <strong>hide form footer buttons</strong> when editing, and to <strong>trigger rules on save</strong> against a set field when saving edits.</p><p><img src=/images/enable-edit-action.jpg alt="Enable edit action"></p><p>For c) custom actions, you can set your own custom action and create an action label against a particular form field. This means that the user(s) assigning the custom action will see the labelled action designated for them. As a designer you can choose the <strong>action display mode</strong> as read-only, edit or both, so you can decide what type of access the user(s) will have.</p></li></ol><h3 id=changing-form-display-dynamically-with-rules>Changing form display dynamically with rules</h3><p>If you use the <strong>Form action</strong> rule called <strong>Field display mode</strong>, you can change how a field or form displays <strong>dynamically</strong>. For example you have a condition set that the display will change based on the condition being present or not.</p><p>When you add this rule, under <strong>Action</strong> you can choose a field or form and choose from <strong>Edit mode</strong> or <strong>Read mode</strong>.</p><p><img src=/images/field-display-rule.jpg alt="Field display rule"></p><p>For more information on this rule go to <a href=/platform/rules/form-actions/field-display-mode/>Field Display mode rule</a>.</p><p>Other rules can be used in other ways to change process workflow and therefore how forms behave. For example using the <a href=/platform/rules/workflow/assign-form/>Assign form rule</a> you can assign a form to a particular user, making them the form owner, and therefore giving them edit access to the form.</p><h3 id=whats-next--idea-iconimages18png>What&rsquo;s next <img src=/images/18.png alt="Idea icon"></h3><p>To read more about form ownership go to <a href=/platform/application-designer/forms/form-owners/>Form owner</a>.
