<p>The <strong>Data sources</strong> function is found under <strong>Administration</strong> in the left-hand side menu, and provides an easy way to create connections to ERP, CRM and IT systems. These connections allow you to combine multiple sources of data in one place and from there Kianda processes can use and update the data to creative effective workflows.</p><h2 id=predefined-data-connectors>Predefined data connectors</h2><p>Connecting to data in Kianda is a breeze. You can quickly connect to a data source, for example data in Salesforce, and use this data in Kianda forms and dashboards. The connection is called a <strong>data connector</strong> and Kianda comes with a predefined set of data connectors, these include:</p><ul>
<li><a href=active-directory/>Active Directory</a></li><li><a href=docusign/>DocuSign</a></li><li><a href=dropbox/>Dropbox</a></li><li><a href=email/>Email</a></li><li><a href=file-system/>File system</a></li><li><a href=ftp/>FTP</a></li><li><a href=google-drive/>Google Drive</a></li><li><a href=mysql/>MySQL</a></li><li><a href=office-365/>Office 365</a></li><li><a href=oracle-database/>Oracle</a></li><li><a href=powershell/>PowerShell</a></li><li><a href=/platform/connectors/rest/>REST Service</a></li><li><a href=salesforce/>Salesforce</a></li><li><a href=sap/>SAP</a></li><li><a href=sharepoint/>SharePoint</a></li><li><a href=sql-server/>SQL Server</a></li></ul><p>Click on each of the links above to find out more about each data connector.</p><p>If you have a data source that is not on the list above, you can use SOAP or REST to easily connect to your data source, go to <a href=/platform/connectors/soap>SOAP</a> or <a href=https://docs.kianda.com/platform/connectors/rest/>REST</a> for more information.</p><p>If you are an experienced developer, you can also create your own <strong>Custom connector</strong> customising pre- and post-processing of queries, see <a href=/low-code/custom-connector>Custom connector</a>.</p><h2 id=viewing-existing-data-sources>Viewing existing data sources</h2><p>Only those with the role <strong>Administrator</strong> or <strong>Manage data sources</strong> have access to the <strong>Datasource management</strong> function. To view any existing data sources:</p><ol>

<p>To <strong>see the details</strong> of a data source, click on the <strong>name</strong> of the Data source and from there you are brought to the <strong>Data source details</strong> page:</p><p><img src=/images/datasource-details-eg.jpg alt="Data source details example"></p></li><li>
<p>The details will vary depending on the data source, but there are some common elements:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Display name</strong> - the name of the data source as it will display in your system. Choose something meaningful, as you will use this name in process design to connect your forms to your data source.</li><li><strong>Information about the data source</strong> - this could be a URL, Server name, Client ID, root folder path etc.</li><li><strong>Authentication details</strong> - this could be a username, password, client secret etc.</li><li>Option to use <strong><a href=#kianda-cloud-connect>Kianda Cloud Connect</a></strong>. This software allows you to connect a local system for example a file system, to Kianda. If you enable this feature and download a zip file, you can install the software on your server, allowing the Kianda system to reach your server and get access to data, for example SQL Server, making system integration quick and efficient.</li><li><strong>Test connection</strong> - all data source detail pages will allow you to test your connection using this button to ensure data exchange can happen.</li><li><strong>Save</strong> - at any time you can save details, even if some parameters need to be completed, allowing you to return to the configuration at any point.</li><li><strong>Security</strong> - all data sources can have different levels of security set up, including administrators for the connection, and users of the connection, see <a href=#setting-security-for-data-sources>Setting security for data sources</a> for more details.</li><li><strong>Close</strong> - allows you to exit from the data source details page.</li></ul></li></ol><h2 id=registering-a-datasource>Registering a datasource</h2><p>The video below demonstrates how to create or register a datasource for SharePoint.

It supports full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tables using Kianda’s <strong>Data Rules</strong>, making it possible to integrate SQL Server-driven data flows into Kianda-powered forms, dashboards, and processes. Note: table-level operations are supported; however, creating or deleting tables is <strong>not</strong> permitted.</p><hr>
<h2 id=when-to-use>When to Use</h2><p>Ideal for applications requiring dynamic access, modification, or display of data residing in SQL Server tables. You can bind table data directly to input components such as list controls.</p><hr>
<h2 id=prerequisites>Prerequisites</h2><ol>
<li>Ensure there’s at least one <strong>existing database</strong> on the SQL Server you can connect to.</li><li>Use a login that has the appropriate permissions to establish a functioning connection to the target database.</li></ol><hr>
<h2 id=configuration-steps>Configuration Steps</h2><h3 id=1-access-the-connector-setup>1. Access the Connector Setup</h3><ul>
<li>Navigate to <strong>Administration → Data sources</strong> in Kianda.</li><li>Click <strong>Add new</strong>, then select <strong>SQL Server</strong>.</li></ul><h3 id=2-fill-in-connection-details>2. Fill in Connection Details</h3><p>Provide the following information on the configuration screen:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Display name</strong>: A friendly identifier for the connector (e.g., <code>EmployeeDB Connector</code>).</li><li><strong>Server</strong>: Hostname or IP of the SQL Server (e.g., <code>localhost</code>, <code>192.168.1.5</code>).</li><li><strong>Database</strong>: Name of the target database (e.g., <code>HR_Records</code>).</li></ul><h4 id=optional-authentication-settings>Optional Authentication Settings</h4><ul>
<li><strong>Trusted connection</strong>: Use Windows authentication. When enabled, Kianda Cloud Connect is automatically used.</li><li><strong>User / Password</strong>: SQL authentication if Trusted Connection is not used (requires SQL authenticatication).</li></ul><h4 id=using-local-sql-server-with-kianda-cloud-connect>Using Local SQL Server with Kianda Cloud Connect</h4><p>If your SQL Server is running locally:</p><ul>
<li>Enable <strong>Use Kianda Cloud Connect</strong> to bridge your local PC and Kianda.</li><li>Choose your machine from the <strong>Connectors</strong> list to complete the setup.</li></ul><h3 id=3-validate-and-save>3. Validate and Save</h3><ul>
<li>Click <strong>Test connection</strong>. A successful response should display “Connection test succeeded.”</li><li>Click <strong>Save</strong> to commit your configuration (notification: “Details saved successfully”).</li></ul><h3 id=4-secure-connection-access>4. Secure Connection Access</h3><ul>
<li>Click <strong>Security</strong> and define Admins and Users who can manage or interact with this data source.</li></ul><h3 id=5-exit-setup>5. Exit Setup</h3><p>Click <strong>Close</strong> to return to the Data Sources management view.</p><hr>
<h2 id=local-server-connection-walkthrough>Local Server Connection Walkthrough</h2><p><em>(Optional: Use when working with SQL Server on your development machine)</em></p><ol>
<li>Follow the connector setup steps above.</li><li>Enter <code>localhost</code> as the <strong>Server</strong> and the target <strong>Database</strong> name (e.g., <code>GreenITR</code>).</li><li>Enable <strong>Trusted connection</strong> and <strong>Use Kianda Cloud Connect</strong>.</li><li>Select the local PC as the connector target.</li><li>Test and save the connection.</li></ol><p><img src=/images/sql-server-example.jpg alt="SQL Server connection example"></p><hr>
<h2 id=table-level-parameters>Table-Level Parameters</h2><p>Unlike other connectors, SQL Server connections don’t expose built-in parameters. Instead, when you bind a table—say, <code>Employee</code>—its <strong>columns</strong> populate dynamically into Kianda form controls such as:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Display field</strong></li><li><strong>Value field</strong></li><li><strong>Sort by</strong></li></ul><p>These options adapt to whatever columns exist in the chosen table.
<img src=/images/sql-server-employee.jpg alt="Connecting employee table to list field"></p><p>The list of parameters displayed in the the <strong>Display field</strong>, <strong>Value field</strong> and <strong>Sort by</strong> field will match the columns that we have in the <strong>Employee</strong> table, see image below:</p><p><img src=/images/sql-server-columns.jpg alt="columns in a table"></p><hr>
<h2 id=post-setup-next-steps>Post-Setup: Next Steps</h2><p>With your SQL Server connector configured and secured, you can now:</p><ul>
<li>Use Kianda’s <strong>List control</strong> to bind SQL table data to form dropdowns, lists, or tables.</li><li>Leverage Data Rules like <strong>Find item</strong>, <strong>Create item</strong>, <strong>Update item</strong>, and <strong>Delete item</strong> to integrate CRUD operations into your form-driven logic. You can map form fields as query parameters directly to form fields.</li></ul><hr>
<h2 id=best-practices-for-developers>Best Practices for Developers</h2><ul>
<li><strong>Naming strategy</strong>: Use descriptive display names to easily distinguish between multiple connectors.</li><li><strong>Auth clarity</strong>: Understand the differences between Trusted Connection and SQL authentication—choose based on your deployment model.</li><li><strong>Leverage Cloud Connect</strong> for local development access without exposing servers directly.</li><li><strong>Secure access appropriately</strong>: Use role-based restrictions to uphold data integrity.</li><li><strong>Use dynamic binding</strong>: Rely on automatic column binding to reduce manual configuration.</li><li><strong>Test thoroughly</strong>: Especially when switching between local and remote SQL Servers or between authentication methods.</li></ul></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always>

MySQL is a relational database management system (<strong>RDBMS</strong>) used to manage structured collections of data. This data can consist of anything from a simple to do list to a more complex organisation network. Using the MySQL server as your datasource, you can perform any Create, Read, Update and Delete (<strong>CRUD</strong>) operations using the <strong>Data</strong> rules provided in the Kianda platform, to learn more about data rules go to <a href=/platform/rules/data/>Data rules</a>. Using the MySQL server connector, you have access to all tables within your database from your server, keep in mind that you can perform CRUD operations on data within a <strong>table</strong> of the database, but you <strong>cannot</strong> create or delete <strong>tables themselves</strong>.</p><h2 id=when-to-use>When to use</h2><p>You can use the MySQL Server connector when you want <strong>access</strong> or <strong>modify</strong> data within a <strong>table</strong> in your MySQL server. You can connect the MySQL server connector to a <strong>List</strong> field as its datasource, meaning you can access information from a table and display the information that is stored in the table. For example if your MySQL server contains tables such as <strong>Employees</strong>, <strong>Purchases</strong> and <strong>Standing Orders</strong>, you will be able to connect the list field to one of those tables giving you CRUD access to its data.</p><p>Take a table <strong>Employees</strong> as an example, if this employee table contains data about the employees in your company such as name, phone number, email address and home address. You can <strong>create</strong> a new employee by providing necessary information, you can <strong>read</strong> (display) employee data, <strong>update</strong> employees information for example when a home address has changed and you can <strong>delete</strong> an employee from the table. Those are the CRUD operations you can perform on MySQL server through a process within Kianda.</p><h2 id=before-getting-started>Before getting started</h2><p>When establishing a connection using MySQL data connector, you are creating a connection with a <strong>Database</strong> from a server, not the <strong>server</strong> itself. Before continuing make sure that your MySQL server has a <strong>database</strong> you can connect to. A database can represent any type of data you want to access, and within this database, you need to create a <strong>table</strong> representing the actual data you will have CRUD access to. For example creating a database of your company name such as <strong>GreenITR</strong>, and within this database you can create tables to represent your <strong>Employees</strong>, <strong>Purchases</strong> and <strong>Standing Orders</strong>.</p><h2 id=how-to-get-started>How to get started</h2><ol>

These functions enable you to access a number of DocuSign&rsquo;s functionalities. You can use each DocuSign function by using the <strong>Data</strong> set of rules, to learn more about Data rules go to <a href=/platform/rules/data/>Data rules</a>. With each DocuSign function you use, data needs to be passed into the function know as <strong>payload</strong> and data is also returned, known as <strong>response</strong>. When using the Data rules, you are presented with <strong>Input mapping</strong> which is equivalent to the <strong>payload</strong>. This is used to pass data into the function, for example when you need a document signed, you need to pass in a document file to be signed, in other words, the document file you pass in is the <strong>payload</strong>. The <strong>Results mapping</strong> is equivalent to the <strong>response</strong>, this is used to populate your form fields when a DocuSign function returns data, for example <strong>status</strong> of an envelope.</p><p>Here is a list of all functions available when using the DocuSign data connector. To learn more about the <strong>payload</strong> and <strong>response</strong> for the available functions go to the <a href=https://developers.docusign.com/esign-rest-api/reference/>DocuSign API Reference</a>.</p><ul>
<li><strong>sendDocument</strong> - allows you to send one or more documents to a recipient to get them signed.</li><li><strong>sendEnvelope</strong> - allows you to send a document to a recipient using one of your DocuSign templates.</li><li><strong>listTemplates</strong> - retrieves the <strong>templateID</strong> and <strong>templateName</strong> of all templates from your DocuSign account.</li><li><strong>getEnvelope</strong> - retrieves information from an envelope using an <strong>envelopeID</strong>.</li><li><strong>getEnvelopeSummary</strong> - retrieves a summary of an envelope using an <strong>envelopeID</strong>.</li><li><strong>listEnvelopeDocuments</strong> - retrieves any documents that are contained within an envelope using an <strong>envelopeID</strong>.</li><li><strong>downloadDocument</strong> - allows you to download a specific document using a <strong>documentID</strong> from an envelope using an <strong>envelopeID</strong>.</li><li><strong>listTemplateSigners</strong> - retrieves the name, role and <strong>recipientID</strong> of all signers from a template using a <strong>templateID</strong>.</li><li><strong>getSigningUrl</strong> - retrieves a URL to a signature made on an envelope using an <strong>envelopeID</strong>.</li></ul><h3 id=example-use-case-of-docusign-function>Example use case of DocuSign function</h3><p>Take the function <strong>listTemplates</strong> as an example. The <strong>listTemplates</strong> function <strong>returns (response)</strong> an <strong>ID</strong> and the <strong>Name</strong> of all templates that you have created in your DocuSign account. To use this function effectively, you can use the <strong>Find items</strong> rule in combination with the <strong>table</strong> input. The <strong>Find items</strong> rule will access all templates and map the results into the table. For each template in your DocuSign account, the <strong>Find items</strong> rule will add a table row with the appropriate <strong>Template IDs</strong> and <strong>Template Names</strong> of each template.</p><p>To showcase the functionality explained above, we will apply the <strong>Find items</strong> rule to a <strong>button</strong>; however, it can be applied to a form field, a form or a process (the rule will be executed when the process loads). Each time we press this button, a table will be populated with a list of <strong>Template IDs</strong> and <strong>Template Names</strong> from our DocuSign account.</p><ol>

SAP is an enterprise resource planning software which allows you centralises data between all areas of your business and manage them in one SAP system.</p><p>Data in the SAP system are represented with schemas and tables. Each <strong>schema</strong> represents an <strong>area</strong> of your business and <strong>tables</strong> represent <strong>data</strong> within that business area. Using SAP as your datasource, you can perform Create, Read, Update and Delete (<strong>CRUD</strong>) operations on <strong>tables</strong> within your SAP system using the <a href=/platform/rules/data/><strong>Data rules</strong></a> provided in the Kianda platform. When using the SAP connector, keep in mind that you can perform CRUD operations on data within a <strong>tables</strong> of the system, but you <strong>cannot</strong> perform CRUD operations on <strong>tables themselves</strong>, this mean are unable to <strong>create</strong> or <strong>delete</strong> tables.</p><p>SAP connector also has the ability to use Business Application Programming Interface (<strong>BAPI</strong>) functions through Kianda. This allows you to perform particular business tasks in your SAP system by calling BAPI functions using the Data rules provided.</p><h2 id=when-to-use>When to use</h2><p>You can use the SAP connector when you want <strong>access</strong> or <strong>modify</strong> data within a standard SAP or custom <strong>table</strong> in your SAP system. You can connect the SAP connector to a <strong>List</strong> field as its datasource, meaning you can access information from a table and display the information that is stored in the table. Take a standard SAP table <strong>MARA</strong> as an example, using this table you can display information on your Kianda forms using the data within the MARA table. You can also display information of your custom made tables within your SAP system.</p><h2 id=before-getting-started>Before getting started</h2><p>You need to create a Kianda Cloud Connect connection with your device which will be used in the settings when filling out the SAP connector settings.

When you connect a SAP connector as your datasource, you can choose which <strong>Table</strong> or <strong>BAPI</strong> you want to use when performing CRUD operations. For example when connecting a SQL datasource to a <strong>List</strong> field and selecting a table you want to use, the parameters will depend on what <strong>data</strong> are present in the <strong>tables</strong>. Take standard SAP Table <strong>MARA</strong> as an example. We have an <strong>Employee</strong> table which we select when connecting a datasource to a <strong>List</strong> field, to learn how to a datasource to a list field go to <a href=/platform/controls/input/list/>List control</a>, see image below:</p><p><img src=/images/sap-mara.jpg alt="Connecting MARA table to list field"></p><p>The list of parameters displayed in the the <strong>Display field</strong>, <strong>Value field</strong> and <strong>Sort by</strong> field will match the columns that we have in the <strong>Employee</strong> table, see image below:</p><p><img src=/images/sap-mara-list-field.jpg alt="columns in a table"></p><h2 id=sap-bapi-functions>SAP BAPI functions</h2><p>In order to use <strong>BAPI functions</strong> from your SAP system <strong>effectively</strong>, the <strong><a href=/platform/rules/data/>Data rules</a></strong> within Kianda can be used. Data rules allow you to <strong>send</strong> data as well as <strong>receive</strong> it. For example if your BAPI function needs data when calling it, you can use any of the Data rules for example <strong><a href=/platform/rules/data/create-item/>Create item rule</a></strong> to send data using the <strong>input mapping</strong> section or when receiving data you can use the <strong>on success mapping</strong>.</p><p>Take a BAPI function which retrieves a list from your SAP system as an example. You can use the on success mapping to store the list in a Kianda field. If for example this BAPI function takes an argument where you want to specify how many items from the list it retrieves, you can input that information in to the input mapping section of the data rules. To learn more about on success mapping go to <a href=/platform/rules/general/success-error-mapping/#on-success-mapping>On Success Mapping</a>.</p><h3 id=whats-next-idea-iconimages18png>What’s next <img src=/images/18.png alt="Idea icon"></h3><p>Your <strong>SAP system connector</strong> is now set up and ready to be used in your <strong>processes</strong>.

<h1 id=pg-024ddac0caa22a87008e77d681ac0be4>17 - Active Directory Connector</h1><div class=lead>Kianda Active Directory Connector</div><p>One of the data connectors within Kianda that you can connect to is <strong>Active Directory</strong> (<strong>AD</strong>) also known as <strong>Active Directory Domain Services</strong> (<strong>AD DS</strong>). AD is a logical and hierarchical structured data store of objects which are mostly accounts. Accounts such as <strong>Users, Computers, Groups</strong> and other objects such as <strong>Printers</strong> or <strong>Group Policy Objects</strong> (GPO). For example, you can store information about user accounts within an AD such as <strong>Name, Email, Manager name, Password, Job title</strong> and <strong>Permissions</strong>.</p><p>The Kianda AD connector uses Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (<strong>LDAP</strong>) allowing users to query Active Directory libraries for example to retrieve properties for users. For more information on LDAP go to <a href=https://ldap.com/>https://ldap.com/</a> or <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol</a>.</p><h2 id=when-to-use>When to use</h2><p>Having an AD connector will allow you to access and update information that is stored in your AD database from your Kianda subscription. You will be able to use <strong>User-related</strong> AD functions which will allow you to use the connector when manipulating users within your AD. For example creating users, updating their permissions, moving them between groups or removing them from the directory. To use the AD functions, you can use the <a href=/platform/rules/data/>Data</a> rules that are predefined within Kianda.</p><h2 id=before-you-get-started>Before you get started</h2><p>Before you can create a connection with your Active Directory and your Kianda subscription, you need to</p><p>a) download <strong>Kianda Cloud Connect</strong></p><p>b) create a <strong>specific user for the connector</strong>, defined in your Active directory database</p><h4 id=kianda-cloud-connect>Kianda Cloud Connect</h4><p><strong>Kianda Cloud Connect</strong> is a piece of software that <strong>establishes a connection</strong> between your <strong>local machine</strong> and your <strong>Kianda subscription</strong>. This lightweight app will <strong>sit on your PC or server</strong> where files reside that you need to use in Kianda processes, and therefore is an <strong>on premise</strong> function .</p><p>Kianda Cloud Connect allows data to <strong>travel</strong> from your local machine to the Kianda Cloud Connect service, and then the Kianda Cloud Connect service sends data to your Kianda subscription. This data transfer works both ways depending on what operation you are performing for example <strong>Deleting</strong> a file or <strong>Creating</strong> one.</p><h4 id=user-account-for-the-connection>User account for the connection</h4><p>You must create an <strong>account in your AD service</strong> which will serve as the connector administration account for the data connector, and this account must be a global administrator in order to allow access to functions.</p><p>this account must correspond. Note that this account can only be used to manage the connector for one subscription and <strong>cannot</strong> be used in <strong>more than one Kianda subscriptions</strong> as Kianda Cloud Connect will not be able to tell which subscription you want to connect to.</p><p>To learn more about how to download and create a connection between your Kianda subscription and Kianda Cloud Connect go to <a href=/platform/connectors/kianda-cloud-connect/>Kianda Cloud Connect</a>.</p><h2 id=how-to-get-started>How to get started</h2><ol>

As mentioned earlier, we need to use the Data rules to use these functions and for this example we use the <strong>Create item</strong> rule which is available from the Data rules.</p><ol>
<li>
<p>When creating a user in Active Directory, there are some required properties that we need to provide. Those properties are a <strong>username</strong>, <strong>givenName</strong> (first name), <strong>surname</strong> (last name), <strong>email</strong> and <strong>password</strong>. There are also extra properties that can be provided by expanding a properties tab within the function:</p><p><img src=/images/ad-create-user.jpg alt="Active Directory list of functions"></p></li><li>
<p>We need to create at least five fields that will be used to provide a value as the required properties. We will use a <a href=/platform/controls/input/textbox/>text box field</a> for each one:</p><p><img src=/images/ad-fields.jpg alt="Required fields for the required properties"></p></li><li>
<p>Use the <a href=/platform/rules/data/create-item/>create item</a> rule to use the function. We need to map the text box fields to the appropriate properties as follow:</p><p><img src=/images/ad-create-user-rule.jpg alt="Mapping the required fields to create item rule"></p></li></ol><p>You can apply the create item rule to a button, for example, the submit button. This will result in a user being created in your AD whenever the submit button will be clicked.</p><h3 id=ad-use-case-example---user-synchronisation>AD Use case example - User synchronisation</h3><p>Using AD you can perform user synchronisation for user groups in Kianda. For example by creating a specific group in Kianda, we can allow Group member synchronisation for that group, by choosing the option shown in the image below with, using the AD data connector. See <a href=/platform/administration/users/#groups>Groups</a> for more details on group creation.</p><p><img src=/images/group-member-sync.jpg alt="Group member sync"></p><p>In the example above, the Kianda environment is synchronised with AD, so that any users added to or deleted from the AD database will be added to or removed from the users of the group &lsquo;Company Users&rsquo;. This kind of <strong>user synchronisation</strong> is also possible with <a href=/platform/connectors/office-365/>Office 365</a>, <a href=/platform/connectors/sharepoint/>SharePoint</a> as well as AD.</p><p>By clicking on the Filter button <img src=/images/filter-button.jpg alt="Filter button" style=zoom:80%>within Groups, an <strong>LDAP Filter</strong> can be applied. The LDAP filter is an open format that allows you to perform queries with AD. For example the query below is used to query for users in the IT department with an account that is not disabled (=2).</p><p><img src=/images/ldap-filter.jpg alt="LDAP filter example"></p><p>LDAP queries and more information on LDAP can be found in many pages such as:</p><p><a href=https://ldap.com/ldap-filters/>https://ldap.com/ldap-filters/</a></p><p><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol</a></p><p><a href=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/ldap/ldap-reference>https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/ldap/ldap-reference</a></p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always>

Note that the <strong>user</strong> you are trying to establish a connection with <strong>must be an administrator</strong> and needs to be a <strong>unique username</strong> (email). The username you want to establish the connection with <strong><u>cannot</u></strong> be used in <strong>more than one Kianda subscriptions</strong> as Kianda Cloud Connect will not be able to tell which subscription you want to connect to.</p><p>To <strong>open</strong> Kianda Cloud Connect on your PC, open the <strong>Kianda Cloud Connect app</strong> installed on your PC, and the dialog box below will open. Note the <strong>version</strong> of Cloud Connect is visible in this dialog box, in this example 2.11.5.</p><p><img src=/images/kianda-cloud-connectv2.jpg alt="Kianda Cloud Connect"></p><ol>
<li>
<p>To establish a connection fill out the following:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Machine Identity</strong> - automatically sets the identity using the name of your local PC or server that the application has been installed on. This field is an un-editable value that <strong>cannot</strong> be changed.</li><li><strong>Kianda Username</strong> - type in the username/email of the user from your <strong>Kianda subscription</strong> you want to establish a connection with. This username must be <strong>unique across all Kianda subscriptions</strong> and must be an <strong>administrator</strong>. For example you <u><strong>cannot establish a connection</strong></u> with a <a href=mailto:connector@domain.com>connector@domain.com</a> <strong><u>if this email is used in more than one subscription</u></strong>, as Kianda Cloud Connect will not be able to determine which subscription to make a connection with. For more information on users go to <a href=/docs/platform/administration/users/>Users and groups</a>.</li><li><strong>Kianda Password</strong> - type in the password used to login, for the user in the <strong>Kianda Username</strong> field.</li><li><strong>Workspace URL</strong> - Type your workspace URL without the last forward slash. Example <a href=https://company.ehswise.com>https://company.ehswise.com</a></li><li><strong>Status</strong> - the colour shown denotes if the connection is active, as a <strong>green</strong> colour, or inactive as a <strong>red</strong> colour.</li></ul></li><li>
<p>Click on the <strong>Login</strong> button to establish a connection. It is recommended to have a dedicated Kianda user account that is used solely for the purpose of connecting the data connector to the workspace.</p></li><li>
<p>If the connection succeeded, in the <strong>Cloud Connection</strong> dialog box, click <strong>OK</strong> to complete the connection. Once the connection has been made the log in the dialog box will be populated with messages confirming the login has occurred. A dialog box will open confirming that the connection has been successfully established.

Kianda has the ability to perform <strong>GET, POST, PUT</strong> and <strong>DELETE</strong> operations if they are supported by the webservice. The REST API datasource can support multiple REST methods, all of which can be called independently. Data from the webservice can be pulled into your Kianda workspace and manipulated, or data from Kianda can be pushed to the webservice to be used by other systems.</p><h2 id=when-to-use>When to use</h2><p>You can create a REST API datasource when you want your Kianda processes and forms to have access to a REST API.</p><h2 id=how-to-get-started>How to get started</h2><p>A REST API data connector can be configured by users with the role <strong>Administrator</strong> or <strong>Manage datasources</strong>.

<h1 id=pg-159da54cce37831d3fd8ec41626ce1ec>20.1 - REST Service and Access Token refresh</h1><h2 id=introduction>Introduction</h2><p>When creating a <strong>REST Service datasource</strong> that uses OAuth for authentication, you may want to create a &lsquo;refresh functionality&rsquo; within Kianda. This is achieved by creating a <strong>process</strong> and scheduling the process to run before the Access Token expires.</p><h2 id=how-to-get-started>How to get started</h2><h3 id=create-a-datasource>Create a datasource</h3><p>First you will need to create the <strong>datasource</strong> to connect to the application, for example, creating a <strong>REST Service</strong> with <strong>two REST Methods</strong>. The method titled <strong>Get/Refresh Auth Token</strong> will be used to refresh the Access Token with the scheduled task. For more information on how to create <strong>REST Services</strong> go to the <a href=docs/platform/connectors/rest/>REST Service page</a>.</p><p><img src=/images/sample-rest-service.gif alt="Sample REST service"></p><p>There are five parameters to pass into the request body: <code>grant_type</code>, <code>client_id</code>, <code>client_secret</code>, <code>redirect_url</code> and <code>refresh token</code>, shown below as follows:</p><p><img src=/images/refresh-token-body.jpg alt="Get/Refresh Auth Token"></p><p>These parameters need to be &lsquo;held&rsquo; in a process, see <a href=#create-a-process>Create a process</a> below.</p><h3 id=create-a-process>Create a process</h3><p>Once a datasource is created, a process is created which will contain fields for the parameters for the request body, and will hold fields from the response parameters.</p><p>As shown in the image above there are five parameters in the request body which need to be populated, and <strong>each of these parameters must correspond to a field</strong> in a process.</p><p>In the response body there are five parameters : <code>access_token</code>, <code>token_type</code>, <code>expires_in</code>, <code>refresh_token</code> and <code>created_at</code>, although only <code>access_token</code>, <code>expires_in</code> and <code>created_at</code> is needed. You can obtain the Access Token via the Developer console so details can be entered into Designer directly.</p><p>A form is created using <a href=docs/platform/application-designer/designer/>Kianda Designer</a> with <strong>textbox fields</strong> as well as a button called <strong>Refresh</strong> as follows:</p><p><img src=/images/parameters-as-fields.jpg alt="Response parameters corresponding to form fields to hold values"></p><p>Form rules are applied to fields in the form in the next section.</p><h4 id=form-rules>Form rules</h4><p>Rules are applied to both the AccessToken textbox field and the Refresh button as follows:</p><ol>
<li>
<p>On the <strong>Refresh button</strong> add a <strong>Data rule</strong> > <strong>Set Form Field</strong> which will be used to clear the AccessToken field. Give the rule a title for example &lsquo;Clear Access Token&rsquo; and map a &lsquo;blank&rsquo; value to the Access Token field by &lsquo;pressing space bar key&rsquo; as shown below:</p><p><img src=/images/clear-access-token.jpg alt="Set form field rule to Clear Access Token field"></p></li><li>
<p>On the <strong>Refresh button</strong> add a <strong>Data rule</strong> > <strong>Create item</strong> which will be used to invoke the REST Service to get a new token and map the response back to the process.</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Within the rule, click on <strong>Select data source</strong> and select the datasource created within <a href=#create-a-datasource>Create a datasource</a>, in the example on this page, &lsquo;Sample Rest Service&rsquo;.</p></li><li>
<p>Then select the &lsquo;Get/Refresh Auth Token REST Method&rsquo; as shown below.</p><p><img src=/images/select-rest-method.jpg alt="Selecting Get/Refresh Auth Token REST Method in Sample REST Service data source"></p></li><li>
<p>Under <strong>Input mapping</strong> map the values from the process into the request body. The left-hand column, <strong>Form field or text</strong>, represents the fields within the process or hard coded values. The right-hand column, <strong>Data source field</strong>, represents the values within the <strong>REST Service,</strong> be it the request header, request body, response header or response body**.** For example choose the form field such as grant_type and then in the data source field drill down to the value you want from the REST method.</p><img src=/images/select-data-source-field.jpg alt="Selecting data source field" style=zoom:80%>
</li><li>
<p>In addition to the parameters defined with the <strong>REST Service</strong> the <strong>urlPath</strong> can be defined in the process and passed into the datasource. Map the form fields <code>grant_type</code>, <code>client_id</code>, <code>client_secret</code>, <code>redirect_url</code> and <code>refresh token</code>, into the form fields.</p><img src=/images/get-new-token.jpg alt="Create item rule to get a new token and map response back to a Kianda process" style=zoom:80%>
</li><li>
<p>The <strong>On Success Mapping section</strong> is used to <strong>map the result from the API call back into the process</strong>. Map <code>access_token</code>, <code>refresh_token</code>, <code>expires_in</code> and <code>created_at</code>, to the relative form fields.</p></li></ul></li><li>
<p>In addition to the parameters defined with the <strong>REST Service</strong> the <strong>urlPath</strong> can be defined in the process and passed into the datasource.</p></li><li>
<p>On the <strong>Refresh button</strong> add a <strong>Form action rule</strong> > <strong>Save form</strong> so that the details from the process are saved to the system database. The rule order then is as follows:</p></li></ol><p>Finally; run the Process in preview mode, ensure the details you want to pass into the <strong>REST Service</strong> are correct and save the process. Take note of the Process ID as this will be needed for setting up the Scheduled Task</p><p><strong>Create the Scheduled Task</strong></p><p>The final step will be to create the scheduled task that will run before the refresh token expires. Navigate to the <strong>Scheduled tasks</strong> within the <strong>Administration</strong> section in the site. Click on the <strong>Schedule a task</strong> button and fill in the dialog box.</p><ol>
<li>
<p>Enter a name for the task in the <strong>Task Name</strong> field.</p></li><li>
<p>Under <strong>Schedule</strong> select the <strong>Minutes</strong> option. In the <strong>Every</strong> <strong>Minutes</strong> field enter a numerical value. For example, if the Access Token expires every 60 minutes, enter 55, meaning the schedule will run every 55 minutes.</p></li><li>
<p>Leave the <strong>Expire</strong> checkbox blank as this schedule should never stop.</p></li><li>
<p>Under <strong>Process Design</strong> select the name of the process that you created in the step above. This will expose a new field called <strong>Select the field or rule to trigger on schedule.</strong></p></li><li>
<p>In <strong>Process ID</strong> enter the ID of the process that you created in preview mode.</p></li><li>
<p>In <strong>Select the field or rule to trigger on schedule</strong> select the <strong>Refresh</strong> button.</p></li><li>
<p>Click <strong>OK</strong> to save.</p></li></ol><p>The Schedule is now set up and will refresh the access token as frequently as the time entered in the minutes field.</p><p><strong>Next Steps</strong></p><p>The Schedule is now set up and will refresh the access token as frequently as the time entered in the minutes field. This will run indefinitely until a user chooses to delete the schedule.</p><p>The datasource is now available to used and the Access Token is being kept current. The Access Token can be pulled into different <strong>Processes</strong> and used to send further <strong>REST APIs</strong>.
