<h2 id=introduction>Introduction</h2><p><strong>User rules</strong> is one of the category of <a href=/platform/rules/>rules</a> available in Kianda, that enables user-based operations associated with user <strong>properties</strong>, for example <strong>updating</strong> a user property, <strong>retrieving</strong> a user property and <strong>finding</strong> a user based on a property. The user rules also allow you to <strong>invite partners</strong> and <strong>share</strong> a particular process with them. These rules are very useful when you want to do any property actions on a user like find a user or update a property of a specific user.</p><p>Take an example of a <strong>Look up user by property</strong> rule. Implementing this rule will allow you to store a user in a <strong>User picker</strong> field by providing a property of a user, for example user role or email address. See image below when a location is being chosen, a trainer is found that is assigned to the location:</p><p><img src=/images/lookup-user-location.jpg alt="User rules"></p><p>In this example the <strong>Location of training</strong> is a <strong>List</strong> control is connected to a <strong>SQL Server connector</strong>. The Display field, Value field and Sort by of the List control is set to <strong>Location</strong>. With the list control set up that way, we are provided with a list based on our Location column in the database. For more information on how to create a List control and set its datasource go to <a href=/platform/controls/input/list/>List control</a>. See image below to see how the <strong>Location of training</strong> field is set up:</p><p><img src=/images/users-list-control-example.jpg alt="User rules"></p><p>With all of our users, we have set up a <strong>Location property</strong> and each user is assigned a different locations based on where they operate and provide training. The <strong>lookup user by property</strong> is set to <strong>Location</strong> which we provide to the rule by selecting our <strong>Location of training</strong> field. The outcome of this combination will set our <strong>Trainer</strong> field with the user that the <strong>Location property</strong> matches the value specified in the <strong>Location of training</strong> field. To learn more about how to create your own user properties and attributes go to <a href=/platform/administration/users/#modify-profile-attributes>Modifying profile attributes</a>. See image below of the Lookup user by property rule:</p><p><img src=/images/users-lookup.jpg alt="User rules"></p><p>For example when a user selects <strong>Galway</strong> from the <strong>Location of training</strong>, the lookup rule will search for a user that has the location property set to Galway and the result is <strong>Mark Lycette</strong>. See image below to see the SQL database and that Mark Lycette matches with the Galway location.</p><p><img src=/images/lookup-user-db.jpg alt="User rules"></p><h2 id=getting-started-with-user-rules>Getting started with User rules</h2><p>If you go to <strong>Administration</strong> > <strong>Designer</strong> and click on a process or create a new process, then click on <strong>Add a rule</strong> the User rules are found in the left-hand pane when you click on <strong>Users</strong>.</p><p><img src=/images/user-rules-intro.jpg alt="User rules"></p><p>There are four types of User rules as follows:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Get user property</strong> - this rule allows you to retrieve user profile properties like email, department and so on for a current user, or a user defined via a user picker field, and map these properties for use in form logic.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Lookup user by property</strong> - this rule allows you to find users, groups or partner accounts based on input filters.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Invite partner</strong> - this rule sends an invitation to a contact in a partner organization for them to access a shared process.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Update user property</strong> - this rule allows you to update user profile properties, for example if a user moves department, where the update happens in a dynamic way.</p></li></ul><h3 id=whats-next--idea-iconimages18png>What&rsquo;s next <img src=/images/18.png alt="Idea icon"></h3><p>To read more about each of the rule types go to the links below:</p></div></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always>
<h1 id=pg-9e6cd2ed5d32f915c5d3649f5836fd93>1 - Get user profile property</h1><h2 id=introduction>Introduction</h2><p>The <strong>Get user property</strong> rule allows you to retrieve a <strong>property</strong> of a user that has been selected. You can select a user by defining one in a <strong>user picker</strong> field or selecting the <strong>current user</strong>, meaning that the user currently filling out the form will be selected when retrieving a profile property of a profile attribute. For example you can retrieve properties such as <strong>First Name</strong>, <strong>Last Name</strong>, <strong>Email</strong> or <strong>Phone number</strong> of a current user, those property values can be used fill in fields associated with a user.</p><h2 id=when-to-use>When to use</h2><p>Use this rule when you need to retrieve a profile property or a profile attribute from a current user or a user defined in a user picker field.</p><p>You can add this rule:</p><ul>
<li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> to a field</li><li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> to a form</li><li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> to a process (the rule will run on load)</li></ul><h2 id=before-getting-started>Before getting started</h2><p>In advance of using the <strong>Get user property</strong> rule, in your process you need to have created at least one or more forms. The rule also requires you to select a <strong>user profile source</strong>, the source can be the <strong>current user</strong> of the form or a user chosen within a <strong>User picker</strong> field. When selecting the <strong>current user</strong> option, you will target the <strong>property</strong> of the user that is <strong>currently</strong> using the form. When you pick the <strong>user picker field</strong>, you need to create a <strong>User picker</strong> field which is used to select a user to target when <strong>retrieving</strong> a property. The rule also requires a <strong>text box</strong> field which is used as a <strong>container</strong> to store the <strong>retrieved value</strong> of the property.</p><ul>
<li><strong>User picker (required)</strong> - field used to select a user for which you want to update a property. To learn more about user picker field go to <a href=/platform/controls/input/user-picker/>User picker control</a>.</li><li><strong>Text box (required)</strong> - field used as a container to store the value of the property.

<p><strong>Defined in a user picker field</strong> - selecting this option will result in a <strong>Pick a user field</strong> option to appear allowing you to select a user picker field from your process. This will then specify which user you are targeting when wanting to retrieve a property, see image below:</p><p><img src=/images/get-property-user-picker.jpg alt="Selecting the user picker field option"></p></li></ul></li><li>
<p><strong>Field to store user profile property</strong> - you can select a field within your process to store the value of the retrieved property.</p></li><li>

<h1 id=pg-90b20164e3c4ac39a8da65ede0441b36>3 - Invite partner</h1><h2 id=introduction>Introduction</h2><p>The <strong>Invite partner</strong> rule allows you to <strong>dynamically</strong> send out an email to a partner organisation with an <strong>invitation</strong> to <strong>share</strong> a process from your subscription. This rule <strong>creates a profile</strong> for the partner as well as shares a process specified in the rule. You can choose to <strong>generate</strong> an invite link and store the link in a text box field if needed instead of sending out an automatic email.</p><h2 id=when-to-use>When to use</h2><p>Use this rule when inviting a <strong>third-party organisation</strong> from within a process instance, for example when your company must hire a third-party organisation to complete a specific task from your process, you can share this process with the third-party organisation to complete the task. Take a <strong>maintenance</strong> company for example, a process is created to perform a maintenance check. The maintenance company performs a check but some broken parts need to be re-manufactured, therefore the maintenance company sends out a <strong>Partner invitation</strong> to the <strong>manufacturing</strong> company in order to manufacture missing or broken parts as the maintenance company makes checks and fixes but not manufacture parts.</p><p>You can add this rule:</p><ul>
<li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> to a field</li><li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> to a form</li><li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> to a process (the rule will run on load)</li></ul><h2 id=before-getting-started>Before getting started</h2><p>Before you get started with this rule, you need to create a <strong>shared process instance</strong> of the process you intend to share with the partner. To learn more how to create a shared process instance, go to <a href=/platform/b2b-portals/shared-process/>Shared processes</a>.</p><p>In advance of using the <strong>Invite partner</strong> rule, in your process you need to have created at least one or more forms. The <strong>Invite partner</strong> rule also requires you to create a list of fields that are used to hold information about the partner and which process you want to share. See below for the list of fields required in your process before using the invite partner rule:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Partner organisation</strong> - text box field representing the name of the organisation that the partner is part of.</li><li><strong>Shared process name</strong> - text box field representing the name of the process you want to share.</li><li><strong>Contact first name</strong> - text box field representing the first name of the partner you want to share a process with.</li><li><strong>Contact last name</strong> - text box field representing the last name of the partner you want to share a process with.</li><li><strong>Contact email</strong> - text box field representing the email address of the partner you want to share a process with.</li><li><strong>Partner country</strong> - text box field representing the country that your partner is situated in.</li><li><strong>Partner city</strong> - text box field representing the city that your partner is in.</li></ul><h2 id=how-to-get-started>How to get started</h2><ol>
