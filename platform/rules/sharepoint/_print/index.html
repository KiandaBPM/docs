<p><strong>SharePoint</strong> rules is a category of rules within Kianda that are associated with SharePoint specific functionality. These rules are using SharePoint Application Programming Interface (<strong>API</strong>) to perform Create, Read, Update and Delete (<strong>CRUD</strong>) operations within your SharePoint connector. The SharePoint rules are designed to <strong>manage</strong> your SharePoint connector instead of populating it with data. With these rules you can create a site, a list or a group on your SharePoint connector along with adding users to groups, removing them from groups or changing user or group permissions.</p><p>Take an example of a <strong>Find a user</strong> rule. Implementing this rule will result in acquiring a <strong>Username</strong> or <strong>User Id</strong> of a particular user which is part of your SharePoint users group. When using SharePoint rules that are managing users, the <strong>Find a user</strong> rule is very useful as rules such as <strong>Add user to a group</strong> or <strong>remove user from a group</strong> require a <strong>User Id</strong> that can be retrieved from the <strong>Find a user</strong> rule.</p><h2 id=before-getting-started>Before getting started</h2><p>In advance of using the SharePoint rules you must have created a SharePoint data connector and establish a connection with your SharePoint site. The data connector is used as part of the SharePoint rules to perform CRUD operations on a site you established a connection with. To learn more about the SharePoint data connector go to <a href=/platform/connectors/sharepoint/>SharePoint connector</a>.</p><h2 id=getting-started-with-sharepoint-rules>Getting started with SharePoint rules</h2><p>If you go to <strong>Administration</strong> > <strong>Designer</strong> and click on a process or create a new process, then click on <strong>Add a rule</strong>, the <strong>SharePoint</strong> rules are found in the left-hand pane when you click on <strong>SharePoint</strong>.</p><p><img src=/images/sharepoint-rules-all.jpg alt="Sharepoint rules"></p><p>There are 10 <strong>SharePoint</strong> rules as follows:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Create a list</strong> - creates a new list in a SharePoint site.</li><li><strong>Create a site</strong> - creates a new site on SharePoint, enabling the use of a site template.</li><li><strong>Create a group</strong> - creates a new group on SharePoint</li><li><strong>Find a user</strong> - finds or searches for a user within SharePoint</li><li><strong>Add a user to a group</strong> - adds a SharePoint user to a SharePoint group. It is important to note the difference between SharePoint users and Kianda users. SharePoint users are users of the SharePoint system. Kianda users are users of the Kianda system.</li><li><strong>Remove a user from a group</strong> - removes a SharePoint user from a SharePoint group</li><li><strong>Reset an item permission</strong>s - changes the SharePoint permissions for a given list, document or folder.</li><li><strong>Check in / out an item</strong> - checks in or out a file in SharePoint</li><li><strong>Get attachments</strong> - reads the attachments from a SharePoint list</li><li><strong>Create anonymous link</strong> - creates anonymous links for a SharePoint held file</li></ul><h3 id=whats-next--idea-iconimages18png>What&rsquo;s next <img src=/images/18.png alt="Idea icon"></h3><p>We have briefly introduced each of the ten types of <strong>SharePoint rules</strong>. Click on the links below to find out more about each rule in detail.</p><p>​</p><p>​</p><p>​</p></div></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always>
<h1 id=pg-58df10a74950e6e44820453d8dc45a4a>1 - Add a user to a group</h1><p>This rule allows you to add a user into a SharePoint group using Kianda.</p><h2 id=when-to-use>When to use</h2><p>This rule should be used when a user within Kianda should be added to SharePoint Group, for example, a new hire being added to a team group during their onboarding phase.</p><p>You can add this rule:</p><ul>
<li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> to a field</li><li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> to a form</li><li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> to a process (the rule will run on load)</li></ul><h2 id=before-you-get-started>Before you get started</h2><p>In advance of using the <strong>Add a user to a group</strong> rule, you need to have created one or more forms. In the forms you must have created two separate fields which are needed for:</p><ul>
<li>Field which represents the <strong>title</strong> of the group you are adding the user to. This field can for example be a <strong>Text box</strong> field. To learn more about how to create a text box field go to <a href=/platform/controls/input/textbox/>Text box control</a>.</li><li>Field which represents the <strong>Username</strong> or <strong>User Id</strong> of the user you want to add to the group, this can also be a text box field.</li></ul><h2 id=how-to-use>How to use</h2><p>To apply this rule, first choose an item to attach the rule to and have a SharePoint data source ready where you want the user to be located. This data source should be a predefined data connector created with <strong>Data sources</strong> under <strong>Administration</strong>.</p><ol>
<li>
<p>Select the field or other item to attach the rule to.</p></li><li>
<p>Click on <strong>Add a rule</strong> > <strong>SharePoint</strong> > <strong>Add a user to a group</strong>.</p></li><li>
<p>In the <strong>Edit rule - Add a user to a group</strong> dialog box, give the rule a <strong>Title</strong>. Then select a SharePoint data source from the drop-down list.</p><p><img src=/images/add-user-group-rule.jpg alt="Add a user to a group dialog box"></p></li><li>
<p>Two new fields will appear:
For <strong>Group title field</strong>, select the field where the group title is stored for example, a list field.
For <strong>Username or User Id</strong>, select the field where the Username or User id is stored.</p></li><li>
<p>Once these fields are set you can also set conditions for the rule, see <a href=/platform/rules/general/add-conditions/>Conditions</a> for more information.</p></li><li>
<p>The final two sections are optional: <strong>On success mapping</strong> and <strong>Error mapping</strong>. See <a href=/platform/rules/general/success-error-mapping/>Success and Error Mapping</a> for more information.</p></li><li>
<p>Click on <strong>OK</strong> when complete.</p></li></ol><h3 id=user-tips-target-iconimages05png>User tips <img src=/images/05.png alt="Target icon"></h3><p>To use this rule, you must have a user predefined in Kianda and in SharePoint. The group must also be predefined in SharePoint. This rule gives the advantage of allowing multiple users to move to SharePoint groups which could be useful for example during restructuring in an organisation, where existing users need to move to other departments/groups.</p><p>If you have multiple rules attached to the field or other item, you may wish to reorder the rules to change the order of rule execution. Go to <a href=/platform/rules/general/multiple-rules/>Multiple rules</a> to find out more.</p><h3 id=whats-next--idea-iconimages18png>What&rsquo;s next <img src=/images/18.png alt="Idea icon"></h3><p>Now that you&rsquo;ve learned about <strong>Add a user to a group</strong>, return to the <a href=/platform/rules/sharepoint/>SharePoint rules</a> page to find out about other SharePoint rules.</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always>
<h1 id=pg-e5eb06c5487f57f8af3f5242e54e6ab3>2 - Check in or out an item</h1><p>This rule allows you to check in or check out an item within SharePoint using Kianda.</p><h2 id=when-to-use>When to use</h2><p>This rule should be used when a user within Kianda wanted to check in or check out an item from SharePoint</p><p>You can add this rule:</p><ul>
<li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> to a field</li><li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> to a form</li><li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> to a process (the rule will run on load)</li></ul><h2 id=before-you-get-started>Before you get started</h2><p>In advance of using the <strong>Check in or out an item</strong> rule, you need to have created one or more forms within your process. When using the check in or out function of the rule, you are required to have a field within your process that specifies an <strong>Id</strong> of an item you want to check in or out. For example the <strong>Item Id</strong> field can be a <a href=/platform/controls/input/textbox/>Text box field</a>. When using the <strong>Check in</strong> functionality of the rule, you are required to create a field which is used to store a comment for the check in, the field type of the comment can also be a text box.</p><h2 id=how-to-use>How to use</h2><p>To apply this rule, first choose an item to attach the rule to and have a SharePoint data source ready where you want to check in or out an item. This data source should be a predefined data connector created with <strong>Data sources</strong> under <strong>Administration</strong>.</p><ol>
<li>
<p>Select the field or other item to attach the rule to.</p></li><li>
<p>Click on <strong>Add a rule</strong> > <strong>SharePoint</strong> > <strong>Check in/out an item</strong>.</p></li><li>
<p>In the <strong>Edit rule - Check in/out an item</strong> dialog box, give the rule a <strong>Title</strong>. Then select a SharePoint data source from the drop-down list.</p><p><img src=/images/check-in-out-rule.jpg alt="Check in/out an item dialog box"></p></li><li>
<p>Three options are presented:</p><ul>
<li><strong>List</strong> - select the list where the item is present which is needed to be checked in/out.</li><li><strong>Operation</strong> - choose from <strong>Check in</strong> or <strong>Check out</strong>. If you choose <strong>Check in</strong>, then select also a field from a Kianda form which will serve as a <strong>Check in comment field</strong>.</li><li><strong>Item Id field</strong> - this will be used to determine which item is being checked in/out. Select the appropriate field from a Kianda form.</li></ul></li><li>
<p>Once these fields are set you can also set conditions for the rule, see <a href=/platform/rules/general/add-conditions/>Conditions</a> for more information.</p></li><li>
