<p>Rules are an important component of any process as they can be used to trigger automated actions, requiring minimal user management once created. There are 60 predefined rules in Kianda covering workflow applications, communications and file management to name a few.</p><h2 id=categories-of-rules>Categories of rules</h2><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Workflow</strong> - Enables you to execute actions that might change the flow of the information within a process.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Communications</strong> - Enables sending emails or meeting requests or even user (push) notifications.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Data</strong> - This is an important and flexible rule group because it allows you to configure CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) actions to configured data sources.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Users</strong> - This enables you to retrieve a user property, updating user properties or lookup for a user based on a user attribute.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>File management</strong> - Allows operations such as the generation of a word document and conversion to PDF and more.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Tables</strong> - Provides specialised rules to enable working with tables like sorting, copying table rows to another table and more.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Dates</strong> - Enables convenient date calculation with advanced options like ignoring weekends or special dates.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Form actions</strong> - Allows operations like submit, save, close and delete forms.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>SharePoint</strong> - Provides a variety of operations to be performed on the SharePoint connection. These rules include operations like create a list, find a user, define permission to an item, check-in / out an item or adding a user to a SharePoint group.</p></li></ul><h2 id=working-with-rules>Working with rules</h2><p>The following headings step through how to view, add, copy, edit and disable rules in processes. It is also important to keep in mind how rules should be listed when multiple rules are used on the same field.</p><h3 id=when-to-add-a-rule>When to add a rule</h3><ul>
<li>
<p><input checked disabled type=checkbox> to a field</p></li><li>
<p><input checked disabled type=checkbox> to a form</p></li><li>
<p><input checked disabled type=checkbox> to a process (the rule will run on load)</p></li></ul><h3 id=how-to-view-a-rule>How to view a rule</h3><p>If rules have already been created</p><ol>
<li>
<p>Select the field or form that contains a rule, for example a button at the end of a form. If a field within a form has rules attached to it, this will be indicated within the form, as shown in the example below where the column <strong>Instances</strong> has <strong>1 rule</strong> attached.</p><p><img src=/images/rule-on-a-field.jpg alt="Rule attached to a form field"></p></li><li>
<p>Under <strong>Rules</strong> in the right-hand pane, click on the given <strong>rule name</strong> to view the rule details, for example a &lsquo;Set form&rsquo; rule called &lsquo;Set link&rsquo; as shown below.</p><p><img src=/images/view-rule.jpg alt="View rule details"></p></li><li>
<p>Details of the rule are available in the <strong>Edit rule</strong> dialog box, for example the <strong>Set form field</strong> rule is shown below.<br>
<img src=/images/rule-details-examples.jpg alt="Rule details"></p></li></ol><p>You can view rule <a href=#conditions>conditions</a> by clicking on <strong>Edit conditions</strong> and actions to be performed as part of the rule are under <strong>Action</strong>. Other features to note in the dialog box are:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Expression</strong> button <img src=/images/ellipsis_frame.png alt="Expression button"> used to add expressions to rules so that dynamic values can be returned based on calculations or form IDs, see <a href=/platform/rules/general/expression-builder/>Expressions</a> for more details.</li><li><strong>Mapping</strong> - mapping is used within rule actions, for example in the <strong>Set form field</strong> rule shown in the image above, the rule updates a form field based on a given value or expression. In many other fields mapping can be used to determine <strong>success</strong> or <strong>error</strong> during rule execution, see <a href=/platform/rules/general/success-error-mapping/>Success and error mapping</a> for more details.</li></ul><h3 id=how-to-add-a-rule>How to add a rule</h3><p>To add a rule to a specific component:</p><ol>
<li>
<p>Select the field you want.</p></li><li>
<p>Under <strong>Add a rule</strong>, <strong>select a category</strong> of rules, and then <strong>select the rule</strong> you want.</p></li><li>
<p>Edit the <strong>rule dialog box</strong> and click &lsquo;<strong>OK</strong>&rsquo;. The rule will be displayed on the right-hand side of the page.</p></li></ol><h3 id=how-to-copy-a-rule>How to copy a rule</h3><p>Duplicating rules can be very useful where you have similar rules that are associated with different fields. To duplicate a rule:</p><ol>
<li>
<p>Select the field with the desired rule.</p></li><li>
<p>Under <strong>Rules</strong> in the right-hand pane, click on the <strong>Duplicate rule</strong> <img src=/images/duplicate-rule.jpg alt="Duplicate rule"> button next to the rule name.</p></li><li>
<p>Choose <strong>Copy to another field</strong> if you wish to copy to another field and select the field you want to copy to. Select <strong>OK</strong> when complete.</p></li><li>
<p>Alternatively select <strong>OK</strong> without copying to another field or click on <strong>Close</strong> at any time to exit the dialog box.</p></li></ol><h3 id=how-to-edit-a-rule>How to edit a rule</h3><p>Follow the steps to <a href=#how-to-view-a-rule>View an existing rule</a> to open the <strong>Edit rule</strong> dialog box.</p><p>In the Edit rule dialog box, you can change:</p><ol>
<li>The <strong>Title</strong> of the rule</li><li>Create or edit conditions for the rule by clicking on the <strong>Edit conditions</strong> button.</li><li>Change how the rule performs by changing details under <strong>Action</strong>. Actions will differ depending on the rule in use.</li></ol><h3 id=how-to-disable-a-rule>How to disable a rule</h3><p>Disabling a rule means that the rule is not active but is still visible in the <strong>Rules</strong> pane. The rule can be activated at any time again by clicking on the toggle button.</p><ol>
<li>
<p>Select the field that contains a rule, for example a button at the end of a form, or a field within a form that has rules attached.</p></li><li>
<p>Under <strong>Rules</strong> in the right-hand pane, beside the given <strong>rule name</strong> slide the toggle button from &lsquo;on&rsquo; to &lsquo;off&rsquo; to view the rule details, for example a &lsquo;Set form&rsquo; rule called &lsquo;Set link&rsquo; as shown below.</p><p><img src=/images/rule-disabled.jpg alt="Rule disabled"></p></li><li>
<p>To enable the rule at any time again follow the steps above and slide the toggle button into the &lsquo;on&rsquo; position.</p><p><img src=/images/rule-enabled.jpg alt="Rule enabled"></p></li></ol><h3 id=where-to-place-a-rule-in-a-list-of-rules>Where to place a rule in a list of rules</h3><p>The rule order refers to the order of execution of multiple rules. To change the rule order:</p><ol>
<li>
<p>Select the field with the rules attached.</p></li><li>
<p>Under <strong>Rules</strong> in the right-hand pane, drag and drop the rules in the order you want them.</p></li><li>
<p>The top-most rule is the first rule to be executed. By default buttons at the end of a form will automatically have <strong>Submit</strong>, <strong>Save</strong>, and <strong>Close</strong> rules. If you create rules you may wish to have these rules placed <strong>above</strong> these shutdown rules so that your rules are executed first before form shutdown.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Rule order becomes important when the output of one rule impacts the execution of another, for example if a process remains &lsquo;open&rsquo; because a user must perform a particular action, then it is useful to have an automated email reminder sent to the user while the process is open. For example
the order of rules on a <strong>Submit</strong> button could be: Set Status, Send Email, Submit, Save, Close, whereby the status of the process instance is set first, before an automated email and then the form shutdown rules of Submit, Save and Close occur.</p><p>To read more about multiple rules, go to <a href=/platform/rules/general/multiple-rules/>Multiple rules</a>.</p></li></ol><h2 id=conditions>Conditions</h2><p>Flexible and dynamic conditions form an important component to make forms fully dynamic. This feature enables you to create natural language conditions when rules should be triggered.</p><p><img src=/images/condition-editor.png alt="Condition Editor"></p><p>To configure a rule to conditionally execute an action:</p><ol>
<li>Select the field or form that the rule will be attached to.</li><li>Under <strong>Add a rule</strong> in the left-hand pane, click on a <strong>category</strong> of rules, for example <strong>Workflow</strong> and then a rule itself, for example <strong>Process security</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Edit conditions</strong> button within the rule.</li><li>Add the conditions that satisfy your scenario. Multiple conditions can be grouped with condition groups.</li></ol><p>For more information on Conditions, go to the <a href=/platform/rules/general/add-conditions/>Conditions</a> page.</p><h2 id=custom-rules>Custom rules</h2><p>Under custom rules, you will find any custom-developed rules available under your developer section. Custom rules provide access to rules that are built for extensibility of Kianda capabilities. This is particularly used in situations when existing rules do not provide the required functionality.</p><p>Custom rules have the purpose of providing a user interface for the end-users. If you need to <strong>build a rule</strong> then you should use a custom rule widget.</p><p>It allows a developer to quickly build a reusable component that would then be used by process designers in real processes.</p><p>Check-out the <a href=/getting-started/welcome/low-code/>development</a> section for more details on how to build custom widgets in Kianda.</p><h3 id=whats-next--idea-iconimages18png>What&rsquo;s next <img src=/images/18.png alt="Idea icon"></h3><p>We have briefly introduced the key concepts of rules. Click on the links below to read more about rule concepts in detail:</p></div></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always>
<h1 id=pg-c73b7a3f718b3435b4c82d05ab02cedc>1 - Adding Conditions</h1><p>Conditions are a key component of Kianda <strong>rules</strong>. They are the <strong>triggers</strong> that result in fully dynamic forms. Conditions enable you to create natural language conditions when rules should be triggered.</p><p>The <strong>Conditions</strong> button <img src=https://academy.kianda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/condition.png alt=img> is found within all <strong>rules</strong> as well as <a href=/platform/pages/>dashboard widgets</a>. Conditions can also be set when setting data source security levels for <a href=/platform/b2b-portals/data-access/>B2B portals</a>.</p><p>Conditions add an important level of interactivity, creating dynamic pathways within a process. These pathways could result from user interaction or from other events that happen.</p><p>Conditions work on the ‘if…then’ principle: ‘if’ the condition exists ‘then’ an action happens, and where applicable, if the condition does not exist, then another action can happen. You can use these principles as steps to implementing conditions:</p><ol>
<li>Create the <strong>condition(s)</strong></li><li>Create the <strong>action(s)</strong> that will be applied as a result of the first condition being in place.</li><li>Where applicable, create the <strong>otherwise action(s)</strong> based on other conditions being in place.</li></ol><h2 id=create-the-condition>Create the condition</h2><ol>
<li>
<p>To create <strong>conditions</strong>, first choose the <strong>process element</strong> you want the condition to apply to – such as a form, set of forms, a field/control or set of fields. This could also be a set of common fields associated with all process instances, such as <strong>Process ID</strong>, <strong>Status</strong> or <strong>Modified by</strong>, see image below.</p><p><img src=/images/common-fields-in-condition.jpg alt="Common fields used in the process element part of a condition"></p></li><li>
<p>Next, depending on whether the rule is applied to <strong>text-based fields, date fields or user picker fields</strong>, choose from 13 text operators, 25 date operators and one additional user picker operator, as shown in the image below.</p></li><li>
<p>Then choose a <strong>value</strong>, this could be typed in text, number(s), date(s), form(s) or field(s).</p></li></ol><p><em><strong>Condition elements</strong></em></p><p><img src=/images/condition-operators.jpg alt="Condition elements"></p><p>In the case of <strong>multiple conditions</strong>, you can use <strong>And</strong> or <strong>Or</strong> to create a group of compound conditions:</p><p><img src=https://academy.kianda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/editconditions-1.gif alt=img></p><p>The result is a flexible process workflow that will result in desired actions based on any number of conditions.</p><h3 id=rule-actions--example-hide-or-disable-rule>Rule action(s) – example Hide or Disable rule</h3><p>To create <strong>actions</strong> and where applicable, <strong>otherwise actions</strong>, the <strong>action will depend on the rule</strong> that is chosen. All Kianda rules use a natural language structure to make it is easy to apply actions. For example, for the <strong>Workflow rule</strong>, <strong>Hide or Disable</strong>, you can choose forms and fields from your process and then apply seven possible actions (as shown below).</p><p><strong>Action elements for Hide or Disable</strong></p><p><img src=https://academy.kianda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/hideoptions-1024x477.gif alt="7 actions for Hide or Disable"></p><p>The actions within <strong>Hide or disable</strong> are:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Hide</strong> will hide a process element (forms or fields) from view.</li><li><strong>Show</strong> will show the element.</li><li><strong>Disable</strong> blocks a user from editing an element.</li><li><strong>Enable</strong> allows a user to add a value to an element.</li><li><strong>Toggle visible</strong> will toggle between showing an element or not, based on subsequent clicks of a field that the rule is applied to.</li><li><strong>Toggle enable</strong> will toggle between allowing an element to be edited or not, based on subsequent clicks of a field that the rule is applied to.</li><li><strong>Hide and clear</strong> will allow you to hide a process element and clear the details. For example, if a toggle button has this rule applied, with an <strong>otherwise action</strong> of <strong>show</strong> on a textbox, then if one value is chosen on the toggle button, the user is allowed enter details into the textbox. The otherwise action is that the field is hidden and cleared of data, so that no data can be retrieved. This might be useful, for example, when sensitive information is used, like a social security number on a form.</li></ul><p><strong>Note</strong>: You can use rules to create <strong>actions</strong> <strong>without conditions</strong> too. In this case the rule will simply execute, for example when a form or field is clicked on.</p><h3 id=whats-next--idea-iconimages18png>What&rsquo;s next <img src=/images/18.png alt="Idea icon"></h3><p>Depending on how the rule is applied, for example to a <strong>Submit</strong> button, the rule order is important to consider, see <a href=/platform/rules/general/multiple-rules/>Multiple rules</a>.</p><p>To find out more about rule implementation, go to the main <a href=/platform/rules/>Rules</a> page and then click on the links to the different rule categories.</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always>
<h1 id=pg-1927f40a06bc75f5a1530e2a2012e2b5>2 - Multiple rules</h1><h2 id=introduction>Introduction</h2><p>When working with rules in forms, a key principle to consider is <strong>rule order</strong>. Rule order is important if there are <strong>multiple rules</strong> attached to an item like a button or form field to determine the sequence of rule execution. As a form designer, you can change the order of execution to suit your specific process design.</p><p>Remember you can assign rules at:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Process level</strong> - onload rules that execute when a new process instance is initiated.</p><p><img src=/images/process-level-rule-example.jpg alt="Process level rule example"></p></li><li>
<p><strong>Form level</strong> - onload rules that execute when a form is submitted.</p><p><img src=/images/form-level-rule.jpg alt="Form level rules"></p></li><li>
<p><strong>Button/field level</strong> - rules attached to buttons or fields within forms, or at the end of a form, for example a Submit button. An example of rule order is given at this level in the section below <a href=#rule-order-example>Rule order example</a>.</p></li></ul><p>Rules are typically synchronously executed in Kianda, so for example when using a <a href=/platform/rules/workflow/start-a-process/>Start a process</a> rule, when the rule is executed first any mappings from a secondary/target process are mapped into a primary process, and from there if there are any rules to trigger on the secondary/target process those are executed, but a rule will only execute when the previous rule has completed. This is different to asynchronous execution where the system will execute rules without waiting for the previous rule execution to finish. Within time defined rules, like <a href=/platform/rules/workflow/start-a-process/>Start a process</a> and <a href=/platform/rules/workflow/schedule-a-rule/>Schedule a rule</a> there is an option to choose between synchronous/in-series or asynchronous/in-parallel where the latter may be useful for rules without dependency.</p><p><img src=/images/execute-in-series.jpg alt="Execute in series option on rules"></p><h2 id=rule-order-example>Rule order example</h2><p>For example, you may want a process to send automated emails to a safety manager, where the email includes submitted form data. In this case a <strong>Send email rule</strong> could be attached to a form <strong>Submit</strong> button so an email is sent once the button is clicked. This will result in an automated email to a designated person. To generate a report of the completed form, you can use the <strong>Generate word</strong> <strong>document</strong> <strong>rule</strong> triggered again when the <strong>Submit</strong> button is clicked. In this example the <strong>Generate word document rule</strong> has to be executed <u>before</u> the <strong>Send email rule</strong>, so that the Word document can be generated and then attached to the email.</p><p>The rule order consideration is therefore particularly important when rules are <strong>dependent</strong> on each other - where the output of one rule is the input of another rule.</p><h2 id=changing-the-rule-order-of-multiple-rules>Changing the rule order of multiple rules</h2><p>In the example below we will look at changing the rule order of a Send email rule attached to a Submit button. The <strong>Submit</strong>, <strong>Save</strong> and <strong>Close</strong> buttons by default already have <strong>Submit</strong>, <strong>Save</strong> and <strong>Close</strong> process rules attached, in order to allow form shutdown.</p><p>To change rule order, when the rule is created:</p><ol>
<li>Click on the item that has multiple rules attached, for example a <strong>Submit</strong> button. Remember by default Submit buttons in forms will have &lsquo;form shutdown&rsquo; rules, namely <strong>Submit</strong>, <strong>Save</strong> and <strong>Close</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Rules</strong> in the right-hand pane, drag the <strong>Send email</strong> rule to the top of the list by clicking on the rule and drag it to the top of the list, before <strong>Submit</strong>, <strong>Save</strong> and <strong>Close</strong> rules.</li></ol><p><img src=https://academy.kianda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ruleorder_frame.png alt=img></p><p>The video below shows an example of a <strong>Send email rule</strong> being created and saved. The rule is attached to the <strong>Submit</strong> button. Once the rule is created, by default the new rule goes to the bottom of the list of rules. To move the rule, simply click on it and drag it to where you wish to place it. In this example we want the email sent <u>before</u> any of the shutdown processes like Submit or Save, but after a <strong>Generate Inspection</strong> rule, so the output from that rule can be used in the Send email rule.</p><video width=100% style=width:100% controls>

<li>
<p>Select the field that will have the rule attached, for example a button at the end of a form, or a field within a form.</p></li><li>
<p>Click on <strong>Add a rule</strong> in the left-hand pane and select one of the rules that uses mapping as shown in the <a href=#when-to-use>When to use</a> list above, for example the <strong>SharePoint rule</strong> called <strong>Create list</strong>, used to create a list in SharePoint dynamically using Kianda form data.</p><p><img src=/images/create-a-list-eg.jpg alt="(Example of a rule with mapping)"></p></li><li>
<p>In the <strong>Edit rule</strong> dialog box, give the rule a <strong>Title</strong>.</p></li><li>
<p>If you want to add conditions for the rule, click on the <strong>Edit conditions</strong> button <img src=/images/editconditions.png alt="Edit conditions button"> to create conditions for the rule, see <a href=/platform/rules/general/add-conditions/>Conditions</a> for more details.</p></li><li>
<p>Under <strong>Action</strong>, click on the field <strong>Select a SharePoint data source</strong> from the drop-down list.</p><p><img src=/images/create-a-list-filled.jpg alt="Create a list example with details"></p></li><li>
<p>Fill out any additional fields as necessary, for example to create a list the following fields must be completed:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>List template</strong> - choose from a list of SharePoint list types</p></li><li>
<p><strong>List name field</strong> - choose a form field that will be used the create a name for the list in SharePoint</p></li><li>
<p><strong>List url field</strong> - choose a form field that will be used in the creation of a URL within SharePoint</p></li><li>
<p><strong>List description field</strong> - choose a form field that describes what the list is about</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Quick Launch menu</strong> - options are <strong>Yes</strong> or <strong>No</strong>. Choosing <strong>Yes</strong> allows the created list to be displayed in the Quick Launch menu, containing a link to the list.</p></li></ul></li><li>
<p>To add success mapping, click on <strong>On success mapping</strong> and click on the <strong>Add mapping</strong> button. See <a href=/platform/rules/general/success-error-mapping/#on-success-mapping>On Success Mapping</a> for more details.</p></li><li>
<p>For <strong>On error mapping</strong> and click on the <strong>Add mapping</strong> button. See <a href=/platform/rules/general/success-error-mapping/#on-error-mapping>On Error Mapping</a> for more details.</p></li><li>
<p>you simply need to select the field within the form which will store the error message</p></li><li>
<p>When you are finished editing the dialog box, click on <strong>OK</strong> or click on <strong>Close</strong> at any time to exit the dialog box.</p></li></ol><h3 id=on-success-mapping>On Success Mapping</h3><p>Success mapping is a concept of <strong>populating</strong> your form fields with <strong>data</strong> that is <strong>retrieved</strong> from a <strong>datasource</strong> using a <strong>data connector</strong>, to learn more about data connectors go to <a href=/platform/connectors/>Data connectors</a>. This retrieved data from the datasource is known as a <strong>response</strong>. Using this response data, you can populate a field within your form, for example you can retrieve a file which is stored in your SharePoint or Dropbox datasource and populate the retrieved file into a <strong>File field</strong>. This will give you the ability to access the retrieved file in your process.</p><p>All data connectors within Kianda may have different response data that can be used to populate fields in a form. You can use the <strong>Success mapping</strong> in the rules mentioned in the <a href=/platform/rules/general/success-error-mapping/#when-to-use>When to use</a> section. Take one of the SharePoint rules <a href=/platform/rules/sharepoint/create-a-site/><strong>Create a site</strong></a> as an example. When all information is filled out in the rule, in the <strong>On success mapping</strong> section you can assess the <strong>data object</strong> (response) called <strong>Site properties</strong>. From the <strong>Site properties</strong> data object you can access three different pieces of data; <strong>Site Name</strong>, <strong>Site Id</strong> and <strong>Site URL</strong>. You can map (populate) those piece of data into fields in your form by selecting a field in the <strong>Form field</strong> section:</p><p><img src=/images/success-mapping.jpg alt="Success mapping example"></p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Form field</strong> - this field allows you to select a field in your form to store the value from the datasource.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Data source field or text</strong> - this field allows you to select which piece of data your want to retrieve from the datasource, and store it in a form field.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Add mapping</strong> - Click on the <strong>Add mapping</strong> to add more fields for mapping results from the datasource to form fields.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Bin/Trash</strong> <strong><img src=/images/bin.png alt="Bin/Trash button"></strong> - Click on the <strong>Bin/Trash</strong> button <img src=/images/bin.png alt="Bin/Trash button"> to delete a mapping.</p></li></ul><h3 id=on-error-mapping>On Error Mapping</h3><p>Error mapping is a concept of populating a form field in your Kianda process when using the rules from the <a href=/platform/rules/general/success-error-mapping/#when-to-use>When to use</a> section. When using those rules, you get presented with the ability to map an <strong>error</strong> when there is an <strong>issue</strong> as the rule is executing, for example incorrectly filling out a parameter. It is useful to know the details of the error message that comes from the datasource your are connecting with. To see the error message, you need to create a <strong>separate <a href=/platform/controls/input/textbox/>Text box</a> field</strong> in your form and map the error to that field. Open the <strong>On error mapping</strong> section and add a mapping by clicking on <strong>Add mapping</strong> button:</p><p><img src=/images/error-mapping.jpg alt="Error mapping example"></p><ul>
<li>
<p>In the <strong>Form field</strong>, select a form field which will store the error message in your Kianda form.</p></li><li>
<p>In the <strong>Error message or text</strong> field, enter an error message that you want to appear in the event of errors or click on the text box and select the <strong>Error message</strong> option to use a system generated error indicating what has gone wrong when the rule executed.</p></li><li>
<p>Click on the <strong>Add mapping</strong> button to add further mappings.</p></li><li>
<p>Click on the <strong>Bin/Trash</strong> button <img src=/images/bin.png alt="Bin/Trash button"> to delete a mapping.</p></li></ul><h2 id=whats-next--idea-iconimages18png>What&rsquo;s next <img src=/images/18.png alt="Idea icon"></h2><p>To find out more about rule implementation, go to the main <a href=/platform/rules/>Rules</a> page and then click on the links to the different rule categories.</p></div></main></div></div><footer class="bg-dark py-5 row d-print-none">
