<p><strong>Workflow</strong> rules is one category of <a href=/platform/rules/>rules</a> that relates to user interactions with form components. Using Workflow rules will allow you to change the flow of information within a process. For example in a simple Training Process that is made up of three forms by default, the <strong>first form</strong> in a process is the <strong>current form</strong>.</p><p><img src=/images/3-form-example.jpg alt="Three form process example"></p><p>In the example above, the workflow for this process would be completion of the forms in this order: <strong>Training Request</strong> > <strong>Training Approval</strong> > <strong>Training Attendance</strong>, however using Workflow rules, you could use <strong>Go to form</strong> to force the <strong>Training Attendance</strong> form to be the current form after the Training Request form has been completed.</p><p>You could also use the <strong>Assign form</strong> rule to assign editing rights to particular users so they can edit forms. See more about Go to form and Assign form below.</p><p>Using rules in this way changes the flow of the process, and additional levels of security and user interaction can be added using <strong>Process security</strong> and <strong>Hide or disable</strong> see below.</p><h2 id=getting-started-with-workflow-rules>Getting started with Workflow rules</h2><p>If you have the role <strong>Administrator</strong> or <strong>Design business process</strong>, go to <strong>Administration</strong> in the left-hand side menu and then <strong>Designer</strong> and click on an existing process or create a new process. Then decide on a form or field to add the rule to by clicking on that item and click on <strong>Add a rule</strong>.</p><p>The <strong>Workflow</strong> rules are found in the left-hand pane when you click on <strong>Workflow</strong>.</p><p><img src=/images/workflow-rules.jpg alt="Workflow rules"></p><p>There are seven types of <strong>Workflow</strong> rules as follows:</p><ol>
<li>
<h3 id=hide-or-disable>Hide or disable</h3><p>This rule is used to hide, disable, <strong>show or enable one or more fields, one or more sections or entire forms</strong>. This rule has special meaning in terms of workflow allowing the application to direct user action and flow by hiding or showing entire sections of the application.</p></li><li>
<h3 id=make-required>Make required</h3><p>Use this rule to make individual <strong>fields required or entire forms</strong>. Unlike the field property &lsquo;Required&rsquo;, this rule will dynamically allocate a mandatory status on chosen forms or fields, that users must complete and submit.</p></li><li>
<h3 id=go-to-form>Go to form</h3><p><strong>Go to form</strong> rule <strong>navigates</strong> the user from the current form to the destination form. This rule could also set the destination form&rsquo;s display mode.</p></li><li>
<h3 id=assign-form>Assign form</h3><p>This rule <strong>enables dynamic form ownership</strong> and form security assignment of a form owner by assigning a user or a group to a form. You could also choose to override or append the form owner. By default only form owners can see the form in edit</p></li><li>
<h3 id=process-security>Process security</h3><p>This rule <strong>defines the security of the entire process instance</strong> (record). Using this rule, you could add any user or group with the right permissions to view/update any instances.</p></li><li>
<h3 id=start-a-sub-process>Start a (sub) process</h3><p><strong>Start a process</strong> rule helps you <strong>create a new instance of the same process or a different process</strong>. You could also map the inputs from the current instance to a new instance.</p></li><li>
<h3 id=schedule-a-rule>Schedule a rule</h3><p>This rule helps you <strong>schedule a rule/rules to be triggered</strong> one time, with a recurring schedule or immediately. For example, this rule could be used to schedule a daily reminder email to a user if the task is not complete.</p></li></ol><h3 id=whats-next--idea-iconimages18png>What&rsquo;s next <img src=/images/18.png alt="Idea icon"></h3><p>We have briefly introduced each of the six types of <strong>Workflow rules</strong>. Now let&rsquo;s look at each of these types of rules in more detail:</p></div></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always>
<h1 id=pg-08bfde79ec35c0b9665ffc6399d74374>1 - Show, hide or disable</h1><h2 id=introduction>Introduction</h2><p>Use the <strong>Hide or Disable</strong> rule to hide, disable, show or enable a field or a component in a Kianda form. This rule is very useful if you want different parts of a form, a complete form or multiple forms, to appear or hide based on how the form user completes the form.</p><p>There are seven possible actions within this rule that can be applied to fields or forms:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Hide</strong> from the user (not visible)</li><li><strong>Show</strong> to the user (visible)</li><li><strong>Disable</strong> for the user (not enabled)</li><li><strong>Enable</strong> for the user (enabled)</li><li><strong>Toggle visible:</strong> toggle between visible and not visible</li><li><strong>Toggle enable</strong>: toggle between enabled and not enabled</li><li><strong>Hide and clear</strong>: hide from the user (not visible) and clear the contents</li></ul><h2 id=when-to-use>When to use</h2><p>You can add this rule:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><input checked disabled type=checkbox> to a field</p></li><li>
<p><input checked disabled type=checkbox> to a form</p></li><li>
<p><input checked disabled type=checkbox> to a process (the rule will run on load)</p></li></ul><h2 id=how-to-get-started>How to get started</h2><p>The following steps illustrate a scenario to <strong>hide</strong> and <strong>show</strong> fields. The same steps can be applied to enable, disable, toggle enable and so on. To dynamically hide a field:</p><ol>
<li>
<p>If you have the role <strong>Administrator</strong> or <strong>Design business process</strong>, go to <strong>Administration</strong> > <strong>Designer</strong>, open an existing process or create a new process and decide which form or field you will apply the rule to, by clicking on that item so that it is in <strong>edit mode</strong> so you can see the Edit/pen button, <strong>Pen</strong> button <img src=/images/penicon.png alt="Pen button">.</p></li><li>
<p>Click on <strong>Add a rule</strong> > <strong>Workflow</strong> > <strong>Hide or Disable</strong>.</p></li><li>
<p>In the <strong>Edit rule - Hide or Disable</strong> dialog box, give the rule a title in the <strong>Title</strong> field.</p><p><img src=/images/hide-or-disable.jpg alt="Edit rule - Hide or Disable dialog box"></p></li><li>
<p>If you want to add conditions for the rule, click on the <strong>Edit conditions</strong> button <img src=/images/editconditions.png alt="Edit conditions button"> to create conditions for the rule, see <a href=/platform/rules/general/add-conditions/>Conditions</a> for more details.</p></li><li>
<p>Under <strong>Action</strong> create one or more actions for the rule by clicking on the <strong>empty field</strong> to add a form or form field, and then choose an option from the action drop-down list, choosing from <strong>Hide</strong>, <strong>Show</strong>, <strong>Disable</strong>, <strong>Enable</strong>, <strong>Toggle visible</strong>, <strong>Toggle enable</strong>, or <strong>Hide and clear</strong>, see <a href=#introduction>Introduction</a> for an explanation of each action.</p><p><img src=/images/hide-example.jpg alt="Hide or disable example - Hide or show"></p><p>For example in the image above, a <strong>Feedback</strong> field will be hidden, using <strong>Hide</strong>, based on a condition, when a field <strong>Management decision</strong> equals a value <strong>&lsquo;Yes&rsquo;</strong>.</p></li><li>
<p>To add more actions, click on <strong>Add</strong>. At any time remove an action by clicking on the <strong>Bin/Trash</strong> icon <img src=/images/bin.png alt="Bin/Trash button"> beside the name of the action.</p></li><li>
<p>Just like an &lsquo;if..else&rsquo; statement, you can add alternative/elsewise actions, based on different conditions by clicking on <strong>Add otherwise action</strong>.</p><p><img src=/images/hide-or-show-example.jpg alt="Hide or show example"></p><p>In the example above, <strong>Signature</strong> and <strong>Training materials</strong> field will show and a <strong>Feedback</strong> field will hide, while a <strong>Management decision</strong> field has a value of <strong>Yes</strong>, otherwise the shown fields will hide, while the <strong>Feedback</strong> field shows <strong>No</strong>. The result is a dynamic form that will reveal particular fields based on user input for the Management decision field.</p></li><li>
<p>To remove the otherwise action(s), click on the <strong>Remove otherwise action</strong> fields.</p></li><li>
<p>When you are finished editing the dialog box, click on <strong>OK</strong> or click on <strong>Close</strong> at any time to exit the dialog box.</p></li><li>
<p>If the rule is attached to a field within a form, a rule notification will appear within the form design, for example a rule is applied to the field <strong>Management decision</strong> as shown in the image below.</p><p><img src=/images/rule-in-form-example.jpg alt="Rule on a form field"></p></li><li>
<p>When you click on the field or form that has the rule attached, the rule will appear in the right-hand pane under <strong>Rules</strong>.</p><p><img src=/images/hide-or-show-rule.jpg alt="Hide or disable rule example"></p><p>The next section will cover how to use the buttons visible in the right-hand pane to manipulate the rule.</p></li></ol><h3 id=editing-deleting-or-duplicating-rules>Editing, deleting or duplicating rules</h3><p>When you have clicked on an existing rule, and the rule is visible in the right-hand pane under <strong>Rules</strong>, there are a number of options available to you.</p><ol>
<li>
<p>To <strong>disable</strong> a rule, click the slider across beside the rule name.</p><p><img src=/images/disable-rule.jpg alt="Disable a rule"></p></li><li>
<p>To <strong>copy</strong> a rule, click on the <strong>Duplicate</strong> button <img src=/images/duplicate-button.jpg alt="Duplicate button"> beside the rule name.</p></li><li>
<p>To <strong>delete</strong> a rule, click on the <strong>Bin/Trash</strong> button <img src=/images/bin.png alt="Bin/Trash button">.</p></li><li>
<p>To <strong>view</strong> a rule, click on the <strong>rule name</strong> to open the <strong>Edit rule</strong> dialog box.</p></li></ol><h3 id=user-tip-target-iconimages05png>User tip <img src=/images/05.png alt="Target icon"></h3><p>Note, it is not necessary to add a condition to the rule. In this case the rule will be triggered automatically:</p><ul>
<li>if the rule is applied to a <em>field</em>, then the rule will be triggered when the user enters a value in that field.</li><li>if the rule is applied to a <em>button</em>, then the rule will be triggered when the user clicks the button.</li><li>if the rule is applied to a <em>form</em>, then the rule will be triggered when the form is submitted.</li><li>if the rule is applied to a <em>process</em>, then the rule will be triggered on load, that is when the process is initiated.</li></ul><p>If a rule causes a mandatory field to be hidden or disabled, this will not stop the form from being submitted.</p><h3 id=whats-next--idea-iconimages18png>What&rsquo;s next <img src=/images/18.png alt="Idea icon"></h3><p>To find out more about other workflow rules go to <a href=/platform/rules/workflow/>Workflow</a>.</p><p>To find out more about other rules go to <a href=/platform/rules/>Rules</a>.</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always>
<h1 id=pg-03be7a0e2c7bf57d90c7dea7dcbb71ee>2 - Make required</h1><h2 id=introduction>Introduction</h2><p>The <strong>Make required</strong> rule is used to <strong>dynamically</strong> make form elements required or mandatory for users to fill in, or not required or to toggle between both states.</p><p>It is possible to make fields <strong>statically</strong> mandatory for users to fill in by checking the <strong>Required</strong> property for the field. However using this rule gives a greater degree of flexibility to cause an action based on user input using a <a href=/platform/rules/general/add-conditions/><strong>Condition</strong></a>.</p><p>Take the example of a feedback form, where there is an option for a customer to fill in their name or not. If they do fill in their name however, then a Customer Account Number field becomes mandatory.</p><p><img src=/images/make-required-example.jpg alt="Make required rule example"></p><p>As soon as Maddie fills out her name in the example above, then and only then the Customer Account Number becomes required, indicated by an asterix. This rule could be combined with <a href=/platform/rules/workflow/hide-or-disable/>Hide or Disable</a> rule to make fields appear/hidden based on user input.</p><h2 id=when-to-use>When to use</h2><p>You can add this rule:</p><ul>
<li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> to a field</li></ul><p>The rule can be added at other levels (process, form), but it is most commonly used in the method outlined in the <a href=#introduction>Introduction</a>.</p><h2 id=how-to-get-started>How to get started</h2><p>To dynamically make a field required:</p><ol>

<p><strong>Edit mode</strong> - the user will be able to edit the destination form.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Read mode</strong> - the user will be able to read, but not edit, the destination form.</p></li></ul></li><li>
<p><strong>Set as current form</strong> - choose from the radio buttons <strong>Yes</strong> or <strong>No</strong>.

<p>If you choose <strong>Own process</strong> then choose from a list of processes already created in the system under <strong>Select a process design</strong> using the drop-down list, or start to type in the name of a process and the list will autofill as shown below.</p><p><img src=/images/select-process-design.jpg alt="Select process design"></p></li><li>
<p>If you choose <strong>Partner process</strong> then choose from a list of predefined partners under <strong>Select a process design</strong>. Click on the drop-down list to add <strong>Partners</strong>. To read more about how to define partners in Kianda go to <a href=/platform/b2b-portals/partner-profile/>Invite partners</a> section of Kianda. Note, the partner organisation <strong>must have enabled process security</strong> to allow your process to interact with the target process, go to <a href=/security/process-level-security/#process-security-settings>Process security</a> to see where this checkbox is.</p><p><img src=/images/partner-process-start-process.jpg alt="Partner process"></p><ul>
<li>
<p>When the design is chosen, other options will appear in the <strong>Edit rule</strong> dialog box, the <strong>Lookup existing process</strong> option appears, where you can choose <strong>Yes</strong> or <strong>No</strong>.</p><p><img src=/images/lookup-existing-process-yes.jpg alt="Lookup existing process option Yes"></p><ul>
<li>If you choose <strong>No</strong> then that means you are creating a <strong>new process instance</strong> from that process design.</li><li>If you choose <strong>Yes</strong> then that means you are <strong>updating an existing process instance</strong> and you must provide a field containing the target process name. You will also need to <strong>provide</strong> for the existing process instance. This can be done using the <a href=#on-success-mapping><strong>On success mapping</strong></a> section, see below.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>
<p>An <a href=#input-mapping>Input mapping</a> section allows you to map values for fields from the primary process to the secondary/target process fields, read more below.</p></li><li>
<p>A <a href=#table-mapping>Table mapping</a> section allows you to map values from a table(s) in the primary process to the secondary/target process table(s), see below.</p></li><li>
<p>Use <a href=#on-success-mapping>On success mapping</a> to retrieve values from the secondary process, showing success in process execution. Click on the link to read more.</p><p><img src=/images/lookup-existing-process.jpg alt="Edit rule dialog box options"></p></li><li>
<p>The remaining options in the <strong>Edit rule</strong> dialog box are explained below.</p></li><li>
<p>Click <strong>OK</strong> when you are finished editing the dialog box, or <strong>Close</strong> at any time to exit the dialog box.</p></li></ol><h3 id=input-mapping>Input mapping</h3><p>For Input mapping you can map field values from one process to another. For example in an &lsquo;Onboarding HR process&rsquo;, if a user fills out their name in a <strong>Name</strong> field, then that name/value will be mapped to a field in a form in the secondary/target process &lsquo;Send email process&rsquo; called <strong>New request Name</strong> as shown in the example below. Your forms must already have precreated fields to capture the values from process or user input.</p><p><img src=/images/input-mapping-example.jpg alt="Input mapping example"></p><p>To use <strong>Input mapping,</strong> click on the blue bar for <strong>Input mapping</strong>:</p><ol>
<li>
<p>The process names will automatically appear in the left and right columns once a process design is selected from the drop-down list, see step 5 in <a href=#how-to-get-started>How to get started</a> above. Within each field, choose a <strong>form</strong> and <strong>then a field</strong> that you would like to map the values from one process to another. Alternatively, you can <strong>type in text</strong> to pass from the primary process to a field in the secondary process.</p></li><li>
<p>Click on the <strong>Bin/Trash</strong> button <img src=/images/binicon.png alt="Bin button"> to delete a mapping.</p></li><li>
<p>Click on the <strong>Add mapping</strong> button <img src=/images/add-mapping-button.jpg alt="Add mapping button"> to add further mappings from the secondary/target process to the primary process. Ensure that form fields are already precreated to hold these values.</p></li></ol><h3 id=table-mapping>Table mapping</h3><p>If you use a <strong>table</strong> in your process you can map fields from a table in one process to another in a similar way to the fields in <a href=#input-mapping>Input mapping</a>, but this section includes additional parameters to give you a range of options.</p><p>To use table mapping, you must already have tables created in your primary and secondary processes. Then click on the blue bar for <strong>Table mapping</strong>:</p><ol>
<li>
<p>The process names will automatically appear in the left and right columns once a process design is selected from the drop-down list, see step 5 in <a href=#how-to-get-started>How to get started</a> above.</p><p><img src=/images/table-mapping-example.jpg alt="Table mapping example within Start a Process rule"></p></li><li>
<p>Click on <strong>Add table mapping</strong> to and add input and output tables for each process. Click on a form and then a table of choice.</p><p><img src=/images/table-mapping-adding-tables.jpg alt="Table mapping adding tables"></p></li><li>
<p>Click on the <strong>ellipsis</strong> button <img src=/images/ellipsis-button.jpg alt="Ellipsis button"> to open the <strong>Table mappings</strong> dialog box.</p><p><img src=/images/table-mappings-dialog-box.jpg alt="Table mappings dialog box"></p><p>Options within this dialog box are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Operation</strong> - choose from:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Copy rows</strong> which allows you to copy row data from one process to another. You can also add conditions to the copying process by clicking on <strong>Copy row conditions</strong> to allow you to have conditions on which rows are copied over to the target process. We can add fields or text to the conditions. Click on <a href=/platform/rules/general/add-conditions/>Conditions</a> to read more about conditions in Kianda.</p><p>If you click on the <strong>Action</strong> button <img src=/images/action-button.jpg alt="Action button"> then column titles from the primary and secondary processes are automatically listed under <strong>Column mapping</strong> as shown below, where <strong>Need</strong> and <strong>Reason</strong> are column headings in the table in the primary process and <strong>Customer need</strong> and <strong>Reason given</strong> are column headings in the table in the secondary/target process. In the example below, a condition has been set so that if <strong>Need</strong> equals the text &lsquo;Broadband connection&rsquo; then the values input into the columns listed will be copied over.</p><p><img src=/images/table-mappings-example.jpg alt="Table mappings example"></p></li><li>
<p><strong>Update rows</strong> - if you choose <strong>Update rows</strong> then contents of the target process table will be updated. Similar to copy rows, an <strong>Update row conditions</strong> button appears allowing you to set conditions for what content is updated. As with <strong>Copy row conditions</strong> you can set <a href=/platform/rules/general/add-conditions/>conditions</a> to control how values are mapped from one process to another.</p><p>An <strong>Action</strong> button <img src=/images/action-button.jpg alt="Action button"> is available beside <strong>Column mapping</strong> to allow you to autofill field names from processes under <strong>Field or text</strong> and <strong>To table</strong> fields.</p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>
<p>Click on the <strong>Bin/Trash</strong> button <img src=/images/binicon.png alt="Bin button"> to delete a mapping.</p></li><li>
<p>Click on the <strong>Add table mapping</strong> button to add more tables.</p></li></ol><h3 id=on-success-mapping>On success mapping</h3><p>If you wish to <strong>update an existing process instance</strong> you can use mapping within the <strong>On success mapping</strong> section to retrieve the <strong>Process ID</strong> of that process instance, and then trigger rules in the target process instance. A <strong>text box</strong> field within the form can be created to hold the Process ID value, see <a href=#before-getting-started>Before getting started</a>. The ID for the existing process instance, is one of the <a href=/platform/application-designer/process/common-fields/>Common fields</a> that can be pulled from the system.</p><p>To use On success mapping:</p><ol>
<li>
<p>Click on the green bar of <strong>On success mapping</strong> to reveal primary and secondary/target process form fields. For example in the image below, the primary process is called <strong>Onboarding HR</strong> and the secondary process is called <strong>Send email process</strong>. Both of these appear automatically below when the green bar is clicked on.</p><ul>
<li>From here you can choose to add in form fields, for example a text box field called <strong>Sales Onboarding Process ID</strong> that will hold a common field <strong>Process ID</strong> from the target process.</li></ul><p><img src=/images/success-mapping-start-rule.jpg alt="On success mapping options"></p><ul>
<li>Click on the <strong>Bin/Trash</strong> button <img src=/images/binicon.png alt="Bin button"> to delete a mapping.</li><li>Click on the <strong>Add mapping</strong> button <img src=/images/add-mapping-button.jpg alt="Add mapping button"> to add further mappings from the secondary/target process to the primary process. Ensure that form fields are already precreated to hold these values.</li></ul></li><li>
<p>Further options exist under this section, starting with <strong>Trigger rules in target instance</strong> allowing you to kick off business rules enabling actions in the target process. Options are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>No</strong> where triggering rules is disabled, and no further options appear.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Yes</strong> where triggering rules is enabled, and further options appear:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Select a field or rule to trigger on target process</strong> - clicking on this field allows you to choose a <strong>form</strong> from the target process and from there you can drill down to a <strong>field</strong> to trigger <strong>all the rules</strong> attached to that field, or drill down to a particular <strong>rule</strong> so that only that rule will be triggered as shown in the example below.</p><p><img src=/images/trigger-rule-target-process.jpg alt="Trigger rule target process"></p><p>If you want to <strong>save values passed</strong> under <a href=#input-mapping>Input mapping</a> then trigger the <strong>Save</strong> button (that contains the <strong>Save process</strong> and <strong>Close</strong> rules) found by default in all Kianda forms.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Enable real-time rule execution</strong>? - options are <strong>Yes</strong> or <strong>No</strong>. If you choose <strong>Yes</strong>, rules in the secondary/target process instance will trigger without any delay in the server. If you choose <strong>No</strong> then a second option becomes available to allow you to choose to <strong>Execute in series?</strong></p><p><img src=/images/rule-execution-options.jpg alt="Rule execution options"></p><ul>
<li><strong>Execute in series</strong>? - options are <strong>Yes</strong> or <strong>No</strong>. If you choose <strong>No</strong> then the server side execution of rules will happen in series or in sequence, instead of in parallel. In series or in sequence refers to synchronous execution, where a rule will only execute when the previous rule has completed. In parallel refers to asynchronous execution whereby rules execute without waiting for the previous rule to finish. This type of execution is useful when rules are not dependent on each other, for example the output of one rule is not used as input for another.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>

<h1 id=pg-74b10c5e2e6f837732e8c3f2dd7591ca>7 - Schedule a rule</h1><h2 id=introduction>Introduction</h2><p><strong>Schedule a rule</strong> allows you to schedule a rule or a field to be triggered <strong>immediately</strong>, at some <strong>point in the future</strong> or <strong>recurring</strong>. If a form field has <strong>multiple</strong> rules attached to it, that include the <strong>Schedule a rule</strong> rule, rules can execute sequentially and you can change the order of the rule execution, see <a href=/platform/rules/general/multiple-rules/>Multiple rules</a> for details. You can also select a specific rule to execute. For example in the image below, the text box field <strong>First Name</strong> is expanded to show two rules. You can select all or just one rule to be triggered. You can select all rules by selecting the <strong>First Name</strong> text box itself or to select just one rule you can expand the field and selecting the desired rule you want to schedule:</p><p><img src=/images/schedule-rule-single-rule.jpg alt="Selecting one rule to be triggered"></p><h2 id=when-to-use>When to use</h2><p>You can add this rule:</p><ul>
<li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> to a field</li><li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> to a form</li><li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> to a process (the rule will run on load)</li></ul><h2 id=how-to-get-started>How to get started</h2><p>The following step illustrates a scenario to schedule a reminder email using the <a href=/platform/rules/communications/send-email/>Send email rule</a> when a form is submitted:</p><ol>
<li>
<p>Click on an existing process by going to <strong>Administration</strong> > <strong>Designer</strong> and decide which form, or field you will apply the rule to, by clicking on that item so that it is in <strong>edit mode</strong> so you can see the Edit/pen button, <strong>Pen</strong> button <img src=/images/penicon.png alt="Pen button">.</p></li><li>
<p>Click on <strong>Add a rule</strong> > <strong>Workflow</strong> > <strong>Schedule a rule</strong>.</p></li><li>
<p>In the <strong>Edit rule - Schedule a rule</strong> dialog box, give the rule a title in the <strong>Title</strong> field.</p><p><img src=/images/schedule-rule-details.jpg alt="Go to form rule"></p></li><li>
<p>If you want to add conditions for the rule, click on the <strong>Edit conditions</strong> button <img src=/images/editconditions.png alt="Edit conditions button"> to create conditions for the rule, see <a href=/platform/rules/general/add-conditions/>Conditions</a> for more details.</p></li><li>
<p>Under <strong>Action</strong> fill out the following:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Select the field or rule to trigger on schedule</strong> - allows you to select a field or rule you want to trigger. If a field has multiple rules, they will be triggered sequentially and you can change the order of the rule execution, see <a href=/platform/rules/general/multiple-rules/>Multiple rules</a> for details. You can also select a specific rule from a field with multiple rules by drilling down and selecting the desired rule. In this example we want to select a rule called <strong>Send email</strong> which is attached to the <strong>Submit</strong> button.</p><p><img src=/images/schedule-rule-send-email.jpg alt="Schedule a send email rule"></p></li><li>
<p><strong>Schedule</strong> - allows you to choose a time of schedule. For this example we will select to send the email <strong>Weekly</strong> at 10 am every 2 weeks.</p><p><img src=/images/schedule-rule-weekly.jpg alt="Schedule a send email rule"></p><p>You can select a different type of schedule that is suited to your rule, here are the options:</p><ul>
<li><strong>One time</strong> - Select <strong>Time mode</strong> as <strong>Absolute</strong> or <strong>Relative</strong> from now. If <strong>Absolute</strong>, you can select the time using the clock icon and the date using the calendar icon or you can select a form field (where the date is stored) by clicking on the icon with black discs <img src=/images/icon-blackdisks.jpg alt=Disks>. If <strong>Relative</strong> from now, enter the days, hours and minutes directly.</li><li><strong>Minutes</strong> - select the number of minutes you want the scheduled rule to reoccur.</li><li><strong>Hourly</strong> - select the number of minutes and hours you want the scheduled rule to reoccur.</li><li><strong>Daily</strong> - select the time of day and the number of days you want the scheduled rule to reoccur. You can select that the rule will trigger only on week days by enabling the <strong>Week days only</strong> checkbox.</li><li><strong>Weekly</strong> - select a day of the week, time of the day and the number of weeks that you want the scheduled rule to reoccur.</li><li><strong>Monthly</strong> - select the date of the month or <strong>First, Second, Third, Fourth, Last</strong> weekday of the month. You can also select a specific time that you want the scheduled rule to reoccur.</li><li><strong>Immediately</strong> - the rule will trigger immediately.</li></ul></li><li>
<p><strong>Expire</strong> - It is possible to set the schedule rule to expire by enabling <strong>Expire</strong> checkbox. For this example we will use the <strong>When</strong> option and apply a condition. The goal of the reminder is to send it every two weeks until the status of the process is completed. In the <strong>condition</strong> of the <strong>When</strong> option, select <strong>Status</strong> from the <a href=/platform/application-designer/process/common-fields/>Common fields</a> and make it <strong>equals</strong> to <strong>completed</strong> as shown in the image below:</p><p><img src=/images/schedule-rule-status.jpg alt="Schedule a send email rule"></p><p>There are three options when to expire the scheduled rule:</p><ul>
<li><strong>By</strong> - the rule will expire by the date and time given. Either select the time using the clock icon and the date using the calendar icon OR select a form field (where the date is stored) by clicking on the icon with black discs.</li><li><strong>After</strong> - the rule will expire after a set number of occurrences. Select the number of occurrences in the blank field or click on the icon with black discs to choose a field where the number of occurrences is stored.</li><li><strong>When</strong> - add a condition which will cause the rule to expire when it is true.</li></ul></li></ul><p>You are also presented with <strong>two more options</strong> when selecting any of the <strong>Schedule</strong> options except <strong>Immediately</strong>, the options are:</p><p><img src=/images/schedule-rule-extra-options.jpg alt="Extra options for the schedule a rule"></p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Make task unique</strong> - enable this option to prevent a second identical task being created for this instance of the process</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Execute in series</strong> - select <strong>Yes</strong> if you want the server-side execution to be in series rather than in parallel.</p></li></ul></li><li>
<p>When you are finished editing the dialog box, click on <strong>OK</strong> or click on <strong>Close</strong> at any time to exit the dialog box.</p></li></ol><h3 id=editing-deleting-or-duplicating-rules>Editing, deleting or duplicating rules</h3><p>When you have clicked on an existing rule, and the rule is visible in the right-hand pane under <strong>Rules</strong>, there are a number of options available to you.</p><ol>
