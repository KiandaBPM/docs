<p>Business rules are what makes Kianda forms come alive. They represent the actual actions users intend to perform when they interact with form components. There are 60 rules you can apply to forms, see <a href=#rules-list>Rules list</a>.</p><p>There are two key principles to consider when working with forms:</p><ol>
<li>
<p><a href=#rule-design>Rule design</a> - you can decide what type of rule you are going to apply and where, as a rule can be applied at field/control level, form level and process level. For the latter the rule will execute &lsquo;onload&rsquo; that is when the process instance is initiated.</p></li><li>
<p><a href=#rule-order>Rule order</a> - if there are several rules attached to an item like a button, then the order of execution is important and can be modified to suit your needs.</p></li></ol><p>These principles are explained in more in the next section on <a href=#how-to-get-started>How to get started</a>.</p><h2 id=how-to-get-started>How to get started</h2><p>If you have the role <strong>Administrator</strong> or <strong>Design business process</strong>, go to <strong>Administration</strong> > <strong>Designer</strong> and click on a process or create a new process, the predefined rules are found in the left-hand pane under <strong>Add a rule</strong>.</p><p><img src=/images/rulesgeneral.png alt=Rules></p><p>There are 10 categories of rules:</p><ol>
<li><strong>Workflow</strong> - rules that represent the actions a user intends to perform when they interact with form components. These rules enable you to execute actions that can change the flow of information within a process. There are 7 workflow rules, see <a href=/platform/rules/workflow/>Workflow</a> for more information.</li><li><strong>Communications</strong> - rules associated with user communication for example sending an email, meeting request or triggering a user alert. There are 4 communication rules, see <a href=/platform/rules/communications/>Communications</a> for more information.</li><li><strong>Data</strong> - rules associated with database operations such as Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) allowing these actions to occur on configured data sources. There are 5 data rules, see <a href=/platform/rules/data/>Data</a> for more information.</li><li><strong>Users</strong> - rules associated with user properties, allowing user lookup based on a user attribute or retrieve a user property. There are 4 user rules, see <a href=/platform/rules/users/>Users</a> for more information.</li><li><strong>File management</strong> - rules concerned with generating documents such as Word, Excel or converting to PDF. There are 7 file management rules, see <a href=/platform/rules/files/>File Management</a> for more information.</li><li><strong>Tables</strong> - rules associated with table operations such as sorting, copying table rows to another table, adding and removing table rows. There are 12 table rules, see <a href=/platform/rules/tables/>Tables</a> for more information.</li><li><strong>Dates</strong> - date rules to calculate time and format dates with advanced filter options like omitting weekends or special dates. There are 4 date rules, see <a href=/platform/rules/dates/>Dates</a> for more information.</li><li><strong>Form actions</strong> - rules linked to actions that are part of forms, for example submit, close or save. There are 6 form rules, see <a href=/platform/rules/form-actions/>Form actions</a> for more information.</li><li><strong>SharePoint</strong> - SharePoint associated rules such as adding, finding or removing users, defining permissions and check-in/checkout of an item. There are 10 SharePoint rules, see <a href=/platform/rules/sharepoint/>SharePoint</a> for more information.</li><li><strong>Kianda AI</strong> - there is 1 Kianda AI rule related to text analysis, see <a href=/platform/rules/kianda-ai/>Kianda AI</a> for more information.</li></ol><h2 id=rule-design>Rule design</h2><p>You can apply rules at button, field, and form level. At form level, rule(s) execute &lsquo;on load&rsquo;, that is when a process instance is initiated or kicked off for example as a result of a user creating a new instance from a <a href=/platform/pages/>dashboard</a>, or automated through a <a href=/platform/administration/scheduledtasks/>scheduled task</a>, then the rules are triggered into action when the form(s) within that process becomes the active form(s).</p><p>To get started with rule design:</p><ol>
<li>
<p>Click on an existing process or create a new process by going to <strong>Administration</strong> in the left-hand side menu and then click on <strong>Designer</strong>.</p></li><li>
<p>For existing processes and forms, decide which <strong>process</strong>, <strong>form</strong> or <strong>field</strong> you will apply the rule to by clicking on that item so that it is in <strong>edit mode</strong> so you can see the Pen button, <strong>Pen</strong> button <img src=/images/penicon.png alt="Pen button"> for example a form Training Approval or Submit button. For new processes, add in forms and fields and select an element to add a rule to.</p><p><img src=/images/formvsbutton.png alt="Edit mode for forms and fields"></p></li><li>
<p>Click on <strong>Add a rule</strong> in the left-hand pane and click on a category of choice, such as <strong>Communications</strong> and then a rule, for example <strong>User alert</strong>.</p><p><img src=/images/rule-design-example.jpg alt="Rule design example"></p></li><li>
<p>When you have chosen your rule, an <strong>Edit rule</strong> dialog box opens allowing you to configure the rule to execute a particular action, which can be according to <a href=/platform/rules/general/add-conditions/>conditions</a> if you wish.</p></li></ol><p>The links at the end of this page will bring you to the different rule categories and from there you can navigate to rule pages to learn what each parameter is in the <strong>Edit rule</strong> dialog box for each rule. The next section highlights where rules can be applied.</p><h3 id=where-to-apply-rules>Where to apply rules</h3><p>As introduced in the section above, rules can be added at <strong>process</strong>, <strong>form</strong> and <strong>control/field</strong> level, and are typically used as follows, bearing in mind that <a href=/platform/rules/general/add-conditions/>Conditions</a> can be applied to rules to control how the rules are executed:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>A rule applied at <strong>process level</strong> executes &lsquo;onload&rsquo; meaning that when a new process instance is initiated, the rule will automatically execute, for example when someone opens a form, a &lsquo;Send email&rsquo; rule could be used to send an email to someone notifying them that a form has been opened.</p></li><li>
<p>A rule applied at <strong>form level</strong> executes when the form is submitted.</p></li><li>
<p>A rule applied at <strong>control level</strong> executes when the chosen field is clicked on, or involved in user or system interaction.</p><p>As with all rules, <a href=/platform/rules/general/add-conditions/>Conditions</a> within the rule determine how the rule is triggered, for example a rule applied to a control like a date field, may be executed only if a certain value is input into another field within a form.</p></li></ul><h4 id=edit-rule-dialog-box>Edit rule dialog box</h4><p>Whenever a rule is added, the <strong>Edit rule dialog box</strong> will remind you where and at what level the rule is being applied, for example in the image below a <strong>Send email</strong> rule is being added to a button/control called <strong>Submit</strong>.</p><p><img src=/images/rule-applied-dialog-box.jpg alt="Where a rule is applied notice in an Edit rule dialog box"></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Make sure that you save the process after adding forms and/or controls and before adding rules so that the names of the processes, forms or controls are committed to the Kianda database. Then the dialog box above can then retrieve the name(s) for use as shown above.</p><h2 id=rule-order>Rule order</h2><p>If there is more than one rule for an item like a field or process, then the order of execution must be considered.</p><p>For example for a <strong>Submit</strong> button on a form, you may want a <strong>Send email rule</strong> to be executed first before any other rule is executed, that is an automated email will be sent before anything else. To ensure this happens, click on the <strong>Submit</strong> button to make sure you are in <strong>Edit</strong> mode, and under <strong>Rules</strong> in the right-hand pane, drag the <strong>Send email</strong> rule to the top of the list by clicking on the rule and dragging it to the top of the list of rules.</p><img src=/images/ruleorder.png alt="Rule order" style=zoom:70%>

<h1 id=pg-9d61c50f58370cccc619c021ac02f668>1 - General rule concepts</h1><p>Rules are an important component of any process as they can be used to trigger automated actions, requiring minimal user management once created. There are 60 predefined rules in Kianda covering workflow applications, communications and file management to name a few.</p><h2 id=categories-of-rules>Categories of rules</h2><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Workflow</strong> - Enables you to execute actions that might change the flow of the information within a process.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Communications</strong> - Enables sending emails or meeting requests or even user (push) notifications.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Data</strong> - This is an important and flexible rule group because it allows you to configure CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) actions to configured data sources.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Users</strong> - This enables you to retrieve a user property, updating user properties or lookup for a user based on a user attribute.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>File management</strong> - Allows operations such as the generation of a word document and conversion to PDF and more.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Tables</strong> - Provides specialised rules to enable working with tables like sorting, copying table rows to another table and more.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Dates</strong> - Enables convenient date calculation with advanced options like ignoring weekends or special dates.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Form actions</strong> - Allows operations like submit, save, close and delete forms.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>SharePoint</strong> - Provides a variety of operations to be performed on the SharePoint connection. These rules include operations like create a list, find a user, define permission to an item, check-in / out an item or adding a user to a SharePoint group.</p></li></ul><h2 id=working-with-rules>Working with rules</h2><p>The following headings step through how to view, add, copy, edit and disable rules in processes. It is also important to keep in mind how rules should be listed when multiple rules are used on the same field.</p><h3 id=when-to-add-a-rule>When to add a rule</h3><ul>
<li>
<p><input checked disabled type=checkbox> to a field</p></li><li>

<li>
<p>Select the field or form that contains a rule, for example a button at the end of a form. If a field within a form has rules attached to it, this will be indicated within the form, as shown in the example below where the column <strong>Instances</strong> has <strong>1 rule</strong> attached.</p><p><img src=/images/rule-on-a-field.jpg alt="Rule attached to a form field"></p></li><li>
<p>Under <strong>Rules</strong> in the right-hand pane, click on the given <strong>rule name</strong> to view the rule details, for example a &lsquo;Set form&rsquo; rule called &lsquo;Set link&rsquo; as shown below.</p><p><img src=/images/view-rule.jpg alt="View rule details"></p></li><li>
<p>Details of the rule are available in the <strong>Edit rule</strong> dialog box, for example the <strong>Set form field</strong> rule is shown below.<br>
<img src=/images/rule-details-examples.jpg alt="Rule details"></p></li></ol><p>You can view rule <a href=#conditions>conditions</a> by clicking on <strong>Edit conditions</strong> and actions to be performed as part of the rule are under <strong>Action</strong>. Other features to note in the dialog box are:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Expression</strong> button <img src=/images/ellipsis_frame.png alt="Expression button"> used to add expressions to rules so that dynamic values can be returned based on calculations or form IDs, see <a href=/platform/rules/general/expression-builder/>Expressions</a> for more details.</li><li><strong>Mapping</strong> - mapping is used within rule actions, for example in the <strong>Set form field</strong> rule shown in the image above, the rule updates a form field based on a given value or expression. In many other fields mapping can be used to determine <strong>success</strong> or <strong>error</strong> during rule execution, see <a href=/platform/rules/general/success-error-mapping/>Success and error mapping</a> for more details.</li></ul><h3 id=how-to-add-a-rule>How to add a rule</h3><p>To add a rule to a specific component:</p><ol>
<li>
<p>Select the field you want.</p></li><li>
<p>Under <strong>Add a rule</strong>, <strong>select a category</strong> of rules, and then <strong>select the rule</strong> you want.</p></li><li>
<p>Edit the <strong>rule dialog box</strong> and click &lsquo;<strong>OK</strong>&rsquo;. The rule will be displayed on the right-hand side of the page.</p></li></ol><h3 id=how-to-copy-a-rule>How to copy a rule</h3><p>Duplicating rules can be very useful where you have similar rules that are associated with different fields. To duplicate a rule:</p><ol>
<li>
<p>Select the field with the desired rule.</p></li><li>
<p>Under <strong>Rules</strong> in the right-hand pane, click on the <strong>Duplicate rule</strong> <img src=/images/duplicate-rule.jpg alt="Duplicate rule"> button next to the rule name.</p></li><li>
<p>Choose <strong>Copy to another field</strong> if you wish to copy to another field and select the field you want to copy to. Select <strong>OK</strong> when complete.</p></li><li>
<p>Alternatively select <strong>OK</strong> without copying to another field or click on <strong>Close</strong> at any time to exit the dialog box.</p></li></ol><h3 id=how-to-edit-a-rule>How to edit a rule</h3><p>Follow the steps to <a href=#how-to-view-a-rule>View an existing rule</a> to open the <strong>Edit rule</strong> dialog box.</p><p>In the Edit rule dialog box, you can change:</p><ol>
<li>The <strong>Title</strong> of the rule</li><li>Create or edit conditions for the rule by clicking on the <strong>Edit conditions</strong> button.</li><li>Change how the rule performs by changing details under <strong>Action</strong>. Actions will differ depending on the rule in use.</li></ol><h3 id=how-to-disable-a-rule>How to disable a rule</h3><p>Disabling a rule means that the rule is not active but is still visible in the <strong>Rules</strong> pane. The rule can be activated at any time again by clicking on the toggle button.</p><ol>
<li>
<p>Select the field that contains a rule, for example a button at the end of a form, or a field within a form that has rules attached.</p></li><li>
<p>Under <strong>Rules</strong> in the right-hand pane, beside the given <strong>rule name</strong> slide the toggle button from &lsquo;on&rsquo; to &lsquo;off&rsquo; to view the rule details, for example a &lsquo;Set form&rsquo; rule called &lsquo;Set link&rsquo; as shown below.</p><p><img src=/images/rule-disabled.jpg alt="Rule disabled"></p></li><li>
<p>To enable the rule at any time again follow the steps above and slide the toggle button into the &lsquo;on&rsquo; position.</p><p><img src=/images/rule-enabled.jpg alt="Rule enabled"></p></li></ol><h3 id=where-to-place-a-rule-in-a-list-of-rules>Where to place a rule in a list of rules</h3><p>The rule order refers to the order of execution of multiple rules. To change the rule order:</p><ol>
<li>
<p>Select the field with the rules attached.</p></li><li>
<p>Under <strong>Rules</strong> in the right-hand pane, drag and drop the rules in the order you want them.</p></li><li>
<p>The top-most rule is the first rule to be executed. By default buttons at the end of a form will automatically have <strong>Submit</strong>, <strong>Save</strong>, and <strong>Close</strong> rules. If you create rules you may wish to have these rules placed <strong>above</strong> these shutdown rules so that your rules are executed first before form shutdown.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Rule order becomes important when the output of one rule impacts the execution of another, for example if a process remains &lsquo;open&rsquo; because a user must perform a particular action, then it is useful to have an automated email reminder sent to the user while the process is open. For example
the order of rules on a <strong>Submit</strong> button could be: Set Status, Send Email, Submit, Save, Close, whereby the status of the process instance is set first, before an automated email and then the form shutdown rules of Submit, Save and Close occur.</p><p>To read more about multiple rules, go to <a href=/platform/rules/general/multiple-rules/>Multiple rules</a>.</p></li></ol><h2 id=conditions>Conditions</h2><p>Flexible and dynamic conditions form an important component to make forms fully dynamic. This feature enables you to create natural language conditions when rules should be triggered.</p><p><img src=/images/condition-editor.png alt="Condition Editor"></p><p>To configure a rule to conditionally execute an action:</p><ol>
<li>Select the field or form that the rule will be attached to.</li><li>Under <strong>Add a rule</strong> in the left-hand pane, click on a <strong>category</strong> of rules, for example <strong>Workflow</strong> and then a rule itself, for example <strong>Process security</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Edit conditions</strong> button within the rule.</li><li>Add the conditions that satisfy your scenario. Multiple conditions can be grouped with condition groups.</li></ol><p>For more information on Conditions, go to the <a href=/platform/rules/general/add-conditions/>Conditions</a> page.</p><h2 id=custom-rules>Custom rules</h2><p>Under custom rules, you will find any custom-developed rules available under your developer section. Custom rules provide access to rules that are built for extensibility of Kianda capabilities. This is particularly used in situations when existing rules do not provide the required functionality.</p><p>Custom rules have the purpose of providing a user interface for the end-users. If you need to <strong>build a rule</strong> then you should use a custom rule widget.</p><p>It allows a developer to quickly build a reusable component that would then be used by process designers in real processes.</p><p>Check-out the <a href=/getting-started/welcome/low-code/>development</a> section for more details on how to build custom widgets in Kianda.</p><h3 id=whats-next--idea-iconimages18png>What&rsquo;s next <img src=/images/18.png alt="Idea icon"></h3><p>We have briefly introduced the key concepts of rules. Click on the links below to read more about rule concepts in detail:</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always>
<h1 id=pg-c73b7a3f718b3435b4c82d05ab02cedc>1.1 - Adding Conditions</h1><p>Conditions are a key component of Kianda <strong>rules</strong>. They are the <strong>triggers</strong> that result in fully dynamic forms. Conditions enable you to create natural language conditions when rules should be triggered.</p><p>The <strong>Conditions</strong> button <img src=https://academy.kianda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/condition.png alt=img> is found within all <strong>rules</strong> as well as <a href=/platform/pages/>dashboard widgets</a>. Conditions can also be set when setting data source security levels for <a href=/platform/b2b-portals/data-access/>B2B portals</a>.</p><p>Conditions add an important level of interactivity, creating dynamic pathways within a process. These pathways could result from user interaction or from other events that happen.</p><p>Conditions work on the ‘if…then’ principle: ‘if’ the condition exists ‘then’ an action happens, and where applicable, if the condition does not exist, then another action can happen. You can use these principles as steps to implementing conditions:</p><ol>
<li>Create the <strong>condition(s)</strong></li><li>Create the <strong>action(s)</strong> that will be applied as a result of the first condition being in place.</li><li>Where applicable, create the <strong>otherwise action(s)</strong> based on other conditions being in place.</li></ol><h2 id=create-the-condition>Create the condition</h2><ol>
<li>
<p>To create <strong>conditions</strong>, first choose the <strong>process element</strong> you want the condition to apply to – such as a form, set of forms, a field/control or set of fields. This could also be a set of common fields associated with all process instances, such as <strong>Process ID</strong>, <strong>Status</strong> or <strong>Modified by</strong>, see image below.</p><p><img src=/images/common-fields-in-condition.jpg alt="Common fields used in the process element part of a condition"></p></li><li>
<p>Next, depending on whether the rule is applied to <strong>text-based fields, date fields or user picker fields</strong>, choose from 13 text operators, 25 date operators and one additional user picker operator, as shown in the image below.</p></li><li>
<p>Then choose a <strong>value</strong>, this could be typed in text, number(s), date(s), form(s) or field(s).</p></li></ol><p><em><strong>Condition elements</strong></em></p><p><img src=/images/condition-operators.jpg alt="Condition elements"></p><p>In the case of <strong>multiple conditions</strong>, you can use <strong>And</strong> or <strong>Or</strong> to create a group of compound conditions:</p><p><img src=https://academy.kianda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/editconditions-1.gif alt=img></p><p>The result is a flexible process workflow that will result in desired actions based on any number of conditions.</p><h3 id=rule-actions--example-hide-or-disable-rule>Rule action(s) – example Hide or Disable rule</h3><p>To create <strong>actions</strong> and where applicable, <strong>otherwise actions</strong>, the <strong>action will depend on the rule</strong> that is chosen. All Kianda rules use a natural language structure to make it is easy to apply actions. For example, for the <strong>Workflow rule</strong>, <strong>Hide or Disable</strong>, you can choose forms and fields from your process and then apply seven possible actions (as shown below).</p><p><strong>Action elements for Hide or Disable</strong></p><p><img src=https://academy.kianda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/hideoptions-1024x477.gif alt="7 actions for Hide or Disable"></p><p>The actions within <strong>Hide or disable</strong> are:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Hide</strong> will hide a process element (forms or fields) from view.</li><li><strong>Show</strong> will show the element.</li><li><strong>Disable</strong> blocks a user from editing an element.</li><li><strong>Enable</strong> allows a user to add a value to an element.</li><li><strong>Toggle visible</strong> will toggle between showing an element or not, based on subsequent clicks of a field that the rule is applied to.</li><li><strong>Toggle enable</strong> will toggle between allowing an element to be edited or not, based on subsequent clicks of a field that the rule is applied to.</li><li><strong>Hide and clear</strong> will allow you to hide a process element and clear the details. For example, if a toggle button has this rule applied, with an <strong>otherwise action</strong> of <strong>show</strong> on a textbox, then if one value is chosen on the toggle button, the user is allowed enter details into the textbox. The otherwise action is that the field is hidden and cleared of data, so that no data can be retrieved. This might be useful, for example, when sensitive information is used, like a social security number on a form.</li></ul><p><strong>Note</strong>: You can use rules to create <strong>actions</strong> <strong>without conditions</strong> too. In this case the rule will simply execute, for example when a form or field is clicked on.</p><h3 id=whats-next--idea-iconimages18png>What&rsquo;s next <img src=/images/18.png alt="Idea icon"></h3><p>Depending on how the rule is applied, for example to a <strong>Submit</strong> button, the rule order is important to consider, see <a href=/platform/rules/general/multiple-rules/>Multiple rules</a>.</p><p>To find out more about rule implementation, go to the main <a href=/platform/rules/>Rules</a> page and then click on the links to the different rule categories.</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always>
<h1 id=pg-1927f40a06bc75f5a1530e2a2012e2b5>1.2 - Multiple rules</h1><h2 id=introduction>Introduction</h2><p>When working with rules in forms, a key principle to consider is <strong>rule order</strong>. Rule order is important if there are <strong>multiple rules</strong> attached to an item like a button or form field to determine the sequence of rule execution. As a form designer, you can change the order of execution to suit your specific process design.</p><p>Remember you can assign rules at:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Process level</strong> - onload rules that execute when a new process instance is initiated.</p><p><img src=/images/process-level-rule-example.jpg alt="Process level rule example"></p></li><li>
<p><strong>Form level</strong> - onload rules that execute when a form is submitted.</p><p><img src=/images/form-level-rule.jpg alt="Form level rules"></p></li><li>
<p><strong>Button/field level</strong> - rules attached to buttons or fields within forms, or at the end of a form, for example a Submit button. An example of rule order is given at this level in the section below <a href=#rule-order-example>Rule order example</a>.</p></li></ul><p>Rules are typically synchronously executed in Kianda, so for example when using a <a href=/platform/rules/workflow/start-a-process/>Start a process</a> rule, when the rule is executed first any mappings from a secondary/target process are mapped into a primary process, and from there if there are any rules to trigger on the secondary/target process those are executed, but a rule will only execute when the previous rule has completed. This is different to asynchronous execution where the system will execute rules without waiting for the previous rule execution to finish. Within time defined rules, like <a href=/platform/rules/workflow/start-a-process/>Start a process</a> and <a href=/platform/rules/workflow/schedule-a-rule/>Schedule a rule</a> there is an option to choose between synchronous/in-series or asynchronous/in-parallel where the latter may be useful for rules without dependency.</p><p><img src=/images/execute-in-series.jpg alt="Execute in series option on rules"></p><h2 id=rule-order-example>Rule order example</h2><p>For example, you may want a process to send automated emails to a safety manager, where the email includes submitted form data. In this case a <strong>Send email rule</strong> could be attached to a form <strong>Submit</strong> button so an email is sent once the button is clicked. This will result in an automated email to a designated person. To generate a report of the completed form, you can use the <strong>Generate word</strong> <strong>document</strong> <strong>rule</strong> triggered again when the <strong>Submit</strong> button is clicked. In this example the <strong>Generate word document rule</strong> has to be executed <u>before</u> the <strong>Send email rule</strong>, so that the Word document can be generated and then attached to the email.</p><p>The rule order consideration is therefore particularly important when rules are <strong>dependent</strong> on each other - where the output of one rule is the input of another rule.</p><h2 id=changing-the-rule-order-of-multiple-rules>Changing the rule order of multiple rules</h2><p>In the example below we will look at changing the rule order of a Send email rule attached to a Submit button. The <strong>Submit</strong>, <strong>Save</strong> and <strong>Close</strong> buttons by default already have <strong>Submit</strong>, <strong>Save</strong> and <strong>Close</strong> process rules attached, in order to allow form shutdown.</p><p>To change rule order, when the rule is created:</p><ol>
<li>Click on the item that has multiple rules attached, for example a <strong>Submit</strong> button. Remember by default Submit buttons in forms will have &lsquo;form shutdown&rsquo; rules, namely <strong>Submit</strong>, <strong>Save</strong> and <strong>Close</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Rules</strong> in the right-hand pane, drag the <strong>Send email</strong> rule to the top of the list by clicking on the rule and drag it to the top of the list, before <strong>Submit</strong>, <strong>Save</strong> and <strong>Close</strong> rules.</li></ol><p><img src=https://academy.kianda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ruleorder_frame.png alt=img></p><p>The video below shows an example of a <strong>Send email rule</strong> being created and saved. The rule is attached to the <strong>Submit</strong> button. Once the rule is created, by default the new rule goes to the bottom of the list of rules. To move the rule, simply click on it and drag it to where you wish to place it. In this example we want the email sent <u>before</u> any of the shutdown processes like Submit or Save, but after a <strong>Generate Inspection</strong> rule, so the output from that rule can be used in the Send email rule.</p><video width=100% style=width:100% controls>

<h1 id=pg-0ecdcce39ec154f1fd1a7aea2916a70c>1.3 - Expression builder</h1><h2 id=introduction>Introduction</h2><p>Expressions allow you to put together form <strong>identifiers</strong> (form field IDs) and <strong>constants</strong> with <strong>operators</strong> and <strong>functions</strong> to return a <strong>dynamic value</strong> that can be used in various places – for example, in a form or field rule to automate processes.</p><p><em><strong>Expressions</strong></em></p><p><img src=https://academy.kianda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/expressions.gif alt="Expression elements"></p><p>For example, expressions could be used in the body of an automated email sent using the <strong>Send email</strong> rule, as shown here:</p><p><em><strong>Expression example</strong></em></p><p><img src=/images/expression-example.gif alt="Expression example"></p><p>In the example above, <strong>[RequesterName]</strong> and <strong>[category]</strong> are identifiers, that are unique IDs for form fields. <strong>ProcessLink()</strong> is a function that will return a link to that process instance. Using the expressions above in an email will mean that every time an instance of the process runs, the values will be presented in an automated email, creating greater efficiencies and personalising the email for the recipient.</p><h2 id=getting-started-with-expressions--example-email-body-text>Getting started with expressions – example Email body text</h2><p>Expressions are recognisable in Kianda from the <strong>Expressions</strong> button <img src=https://academy.kianda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ellipsis.png alt=Expressions> found in <strong>Edit rule dialog boxes</strong> and <strong>other menu items</strong>, such as enabling <strong>quick actions</strong> for processes and <strong>number fields</strong>.</p><p>Within rules, expressions can be created using the <strong>Expression builder</strong> where you can <strong>Add field to an expression</strong> or use the handy <strong>Reference</strong> guide to get a list of commonly used functions.</p><p><em><strong>Expression builder</strong></em></p><p><img src=/images/expression-builder-eg.gif alt="Expression builder example in action"></p><p>Let&rsquo;s look at an example of using an expression in the <strong>Body</strong> section of an email being sent using the <strong>Send email</strong> rule:</p><ol>
<li>
<p>First, add a <strong>Send email</strong> rule to a form or forms, field or fields by selecting <strong>Add a rule</strong> > <strong>Communications</strong>> <strong>Send email</strong> from the left-side pane.</p></li><li>

<h1 id=pg-e1ae04b7b35b9de11d8f5731b4384b33>1.4 - Success/Error Mapping</h1><h2 id=introduction>Introduction</h2><p>Success and Error mapping is used to denote the success or failure of certain rules being executed where data is being transferred or a rule is connected to a data connector. As a user with an <strong>administrator</strong> or <strong>designer</strong> role, you can use Kianda <strong>Designer</strong> to populate fields within the Kianda form, using the <strong>Edit rule</strong> dialog box to set parameters for success and error mapping.</p><h2 id=when-to-use>When to use</h2><p>Success and Error mapping should be with rule execution, displaying values that you want for rule execution success or failure.</p><p><strong>You can use mapping with the following rules:</strong></p><ul>
<li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> Data rules > Find items</li><li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> Data rules > Create item</li><li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> Data rules > Update item</li><li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> Data rules > Delete item</li><li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> All SharePoint rules, except Get attachments and Create anonymous link</li></ul><h2 id=how-to-use>How to use</h2><ol>
<li>
<p>Select the field that will have the rule attached, for example a button at the end of a form, or a field within a form.</p></li><li>
<p>Click on <strong>Add a rule</strong> in the left-hand pane and select one of the rules that uses mapping as shown in the <a href=#when-to-use>When to use</a> list above, for example the <strong>SharePoint rule</strong> called <strong>Create list</strong>, used to create a list in SharePoint dynamically using Kianda form data.</p><p><img src=/images/create-a-list-eg.jpg alt="(Example of a rule with mapping)"></p></li><li>
<p>In the <strong>Edit rule</strong> dialog box, give the rule a <strong>Title</strong>.</p></li><li>
<p>If you want to add conditions for the rule, click on the <strong>Edit conditions</strong> button <img src=/images/editconditions.png alt="Edit conditions button"> to create conditions for the rule, see <a href=/platform/rules/general/add-conditions/>Conditions</a> for more details.</p></li><li>
<p>Under <strong>Action</strong>, click on the field <strong>Select a SharePoint data source</strong> from the drop-down list.</p><p><img src=/images/create-a-list-filled.jpg alt="Create a list example with details"></p></li><li>
<p>Fill out any additional fields as necessary, for example to create a list the following fields must be completed:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>List template</strong> - choose from a list of SharePoint list types</p></li><li>
<p><strong>List name field</strong> - choose a form field that will be used the create a name for the list in SharePoint</p></li><li>
<p><strong>List url field</strong> - choose a form field that will be used in the creation of a URL within SharePoint</p></li><li>
<p><strong>List description field</strong> - choose a form field that describes what the list is about</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Quick Launch menu</strong> - options are <strong>Yes</strong> or <strong>No</strong>. Choosing <strong>Yes</strong> allows the created list to be displayed in the Quick Launch menu, containing a link to the list.</p></li></ul></li><li>
<p>To add success mapping, click on <strong>On success mapping</strong> and click on the <strong>Add mapping</strong> button. See <a href=/platform/rules/general/success-error-mapping/#on-success-mapping>On Success Mapping</a> for more details.</p></li><li>
<p>For <strong>On error mapping</strong> and click on the <strong>Add mapping</strong> button. See <a href=/platform/rules/general/success-error-mapping/#on-error-mapping>On Error Mapping</a> for more details.</p></li><li>
<p>you simply need to select the field within the form which will store the error message</p></li><li>
<p>When you are finished editing the dialog box, click on <strong>OK</strong> or click on <strong>Close</strong> at any time to exit the dialog box.</p></li></ol><h3 id=on-success-mapping>On Success Mapping</h3><p>Success mapping is a concept of <strong>populating</strong> your form fields with <strong>data</strong> that is <strong>retrieved</strong> from a <strong>datasource</strong> using a <strong>data connector</strong>, to learn more about data connectors go to <a href=/platform/connectors/>Data connectors</a>. This retrieved data from the datasource is known as a <strong>response</strong>. Using this response data, you can populate a field within your form, for example you can retrieve a file which is stored in your SharePoint or Dropbox datasource and populate the retrieved file into a <strong>File field</strong>. This will give you the ability to access the retrieved file in your process.</p><p>All data connectors within Kianda may have different response data that can be used to populate fields in a form. You can use the <strong>Success mapping</strong> in the rules mentioned in the <a href=/platform/rules/general/success-error-mapping/#when-to-use>When to use</a> section. Take one of the SharePoint rules <a href=/platform/rules/sharepoint/create-a-site/><strong>Create a site</strong></a> as an example. When all information is filled out in the rule, in the <strong>On success mapping</strong> section you can assess the <strong>data object</strong> (response) called <strong>Site properties</strong>. From the <strong>Site properties</strong> data object you can access three different pieces of data; <strong>Site Name</strong>, <strong>Site Id</strong> and <strong>Site URL</strong>. You can map (populate) those piece of data into fields in your form by selecting a field in the <strong>Form field</strong> section:</p><p><img src=/images/success-mapping.jpg alt="Success mapping example"></p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Form field</strong> - this field allows you to select a field in your form to store the value from the datasource.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Data source field or text</strong> - this field allows you to select which piece of data your want to retrieve from the datasource, and store it in a form field.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Add mapping</strong> - Click on the <strong>Add mapping</strong> to add more fields for mapping results from the datasource to form fields.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Bin/Trash</strong> <strong><img src=/images/bin.png alt="Bin/Trash button"></strong> - Click on the <strong>Bin/Trash</strong> button <img src=/images/bin.png alt="Bin/Trash button"> to delete a mapping.</p></li></ul><h3 id=on-error-mapping>On Error Mapping</h3><p>Error mapping is a concept of populating a form field in your Kianda process when using the rules from the <a href=/platform/rules/general/success-error-mapping/#when-to-use>When to use</a> section. When using those rules, you get presented with the ability to map an <strong>error</strong> when there is an <strong>issue</strong> as the rule is executing, for example incorrectly filling out a parameter. It is useful to know the details of the error message that comes from the datasource your are connecting with. To see the error message, you need to create a <strong>separate <a href=/platform/controls/input/textbox/>Text box</a> field</strong> in your form and map the error to that field. Open the <strong>On error mapping</strong> section and add a mapping by clicking on <strong>Add mapping</strong> button:</p><p><img src=/images/error-mapping.jpg alt="Error mapping example"></p><ul>
<li>
<p>In the <strong>Form field</strong>, select a form field which will store the error message in your Kianda form.</p></li><li>
<p>In the <strong>Error message or text</strong> field, enter an error message that you want to appear in the event of errors or click on the text box and select the <strong>Error message</strong> option to use a system generated error indicating what has gone wrong when the rule executed.</p></li><li>
<p>Click on the <strong>Add mapping</strong> button to add further mappings.</p></li><li>
<p>Click on the <strong>Bin/Trash</strong> button <img src=/images/bin.png alt="Bin/Trash button"> to delete a mapping.</p></li></ul><h2 id=whats-next--idea-iconimages18png>What&rsquo;s next <img src=/images/18.png alt="Idea icon"></h2><p>To find out more about rule implementation, go to the main <a href=/platform/rules/>Rules</a> page and then click on the links to the different rule categories.</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always>
<h1 id=pg-1e5f6b5a91f063f4a6c7ae71d0d4677d>2 - Workflow rules</h1><p><strong>Workflow</strong> rules is one category of <a href=/platform/rules/>rules</a> that relates to user interactions with form components. Using Workflow rules will allow you to change the flow of information within a process. For example in a simple Training Process that is made up of three forms by default, the <strong>first form</strong> in a process is the <strong>current form</strong>.</p><p><img src=/images/3-form-example.jpg alt="Three form process example"></p><p>In the example above, the workflow for this process would be completion of the forms in this order: <strong>Training Request</strong> > <strong>Training Approval</strong> > <strong>Training Attendance</strong>, however using Workflow rules, you could use <strong>Go to form</strong> to force the <strong>Training Attendance</strong> form to be the current form after the Training Request form has been completed.</p><p>You could also use the <strong>Assign form</strong> rule to assign editing rights to particular users so they can edit forms. See more about Go to form and Assign form below.</p><p>Using rules in this way changes the flow of the process, and additional levels of security and user interaction can be added using <strong>Process security</strong> and <strong>Hide or disable</strong> see below.</p><h2 id=getting-started-with-workflow-rules>Getting started with Workflow rules</h2><p>If you have the role <strong>Administrator</strong> or <strong>Design business process</strong>, go to <strong>Administration</strong> in the left-hand side menu and then <strong>Designer</strong> and click on an existing process or create a new process. Then decide on a form or field to add the rule to by clicking on that item and click on <strong>Add a rule</strong>.</p><p>The <strong>Workflow</strong> rules are found in the left-hand pane when you click on <strong>Workflow</strong>.</p><p><img src=/images/workflow-rules.jpg alt="Workflow rules"></p><p>There are seven types of <strong>Workflow</strong> rules as follows:</p><ol>
<li>
<h3 id=hide-or-disable>Hide or disable</h3><p>This rule is used to hide, disable, <strong>show or enable one or more fields, one or more sections or entire forms</strong>. This rule has special meaning in terms of workflow allowing the application to direct user action and flow by hiding or showing entire sections of the application.</p></li><li>
<h3 id=make-required>Make required</h3><p>Use this rule to make individual <strong>fields required or entire forms</strong>. Unlike the field property &lsquo;Required&rsquo;, this rule will dynamically allocate a mandatory status on chosen forms or fields, that users must complete and submit.</p></li><li>
<h3 id=go-to-form>Go to form</h3><p><strong>Go to form</strong> rule <strong>navigates</strong> the user from the current form to the destination form. This rule could also set the destination form&rsquo;s display mode.</p></li><li>
<h3 id=assign-form>Assign form</h3><p>This rule <strong>enables dynamic form ownership</strong> and form security assignment of a form owner by assigning a user or a group to a form. You could also choose to override or append the form owner. By default only form owners can see the form in edit</p></li><li>
<h3 id=process-security>Process security</h3><p>This rule <strong>defines the security of the entire process instance</strong> (record). Using this rule, you could add any user or group with the right permissions to view/update any instances.</p></li><li>
<h3 id=start-a-sub-process>Start a (sub) process</h3><p><strong>Start a process</strong> rule helps you <strong>create a new instance of the same process or a different process</strong>. You could also map the inputs from the current instance to a new instance.</p></li><li>
<h3 id=schedule-a-rule>Schedule a rule</h3><p>This rule helps you <strong>schedule a rule/rules to be triggered</strong> one time, with a recurring schedule or immediately. For example, this rule could be used to schedule a daily reminder email to a user if the task is not complete.</p></li></ol><h3 id=whats-next--idea-iconimages18png>What&rsquo;s next <img src=/images/18.png alt="Idea icon"></h3><p>We have briefly introduced each of the six types of <strong>Workflow rules</strong>. Now let&rsquo;s look at each of these types of rules in more detail:</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always>
<h1 id=pg-08bfde79ec35c0b9665ffc6399d74374>2.1 - Show, hide or disable</h1><h2 id=introduction>Introduction</h2><p>Use the <strong>Hide or Disable</strong> rule to hide, disable, show or enable a field or a component in a Kianda form. This rule is very useful if you want different parts of a form, a complete form or multiple forms, to appear or hide based on how the form user completes the form.</p><p>There are seven possible actions within this rule that can be applied to fields or forms:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Hide</strong> from the user (not visible)</li><li><strong>Show</strong> to the user (visible)</li><li><strong>Disable</strong> for the user (not enabled)</li><li><strong>Enable</strong> for the user (enabled)</li><li><strong>Toggle visible:</strong> toggle between visible and not visible</li><li><strong>Toggle enable</strong>: toggle between enabled and not enabled</li><li><strong>Hide and clear</strong>: hide from the user (not visible) and clear the contents</li></ul><h2 id=when-to-use>When to use</h2><p>You can add this rule:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><input checked disabled type=checkbox> to a field</p></li><li>
<p><input checked disabled type=checkbox> to a form</p></li><li>
<p><input checked disabled type=checkbox> to a process (the rule will run on load)</p></li></ul><h2 id=how-to-get-started>How to get started</h2><p>The following steps illustrate a scenario to <strong>hide</strong> and <strong>show</strong> fields. The same steps can be applied to enable, disable, toggle enable and so on. To dynamically hide a field:</p><ol>
<li>
<p>If you have the role <strong>Administrator</strong> or <strong>Design business process</strong>, go to <strong>Administration</strong> > <strong>Designer</strong>, open an existing process or create a new process and decide which form or field you will apply the rule to, by clicking on that item so that it is in <strong>edit mode</strong> so you can see the Edit/pen button, <strong>Pen</strong> button <img src=/images/penicon.png alt="Pen button">.</p></li><li>
<p>Click on <strong>Add a rule</strong> > <strong>Workflow</strong> > <strong>Hide or Disable</strong>.</p></li><li>
<p>In the <strong>Edit rule - Hide or Disable</strong> dialog box, give the rule a title in the <strong>Title</strong> field.</p><p><img src=/images/hide-or-disable.jpg alt="Edit rule - Hide or Disable dialog box"></p></li><li>
<p>If you want to add conditions for the rule, click on the <strong>Edit conditions</strong> button <img src=/images/editconditions.png alt="Edit conditions button"> to create conditions for the rule, see <a href=/platform/rules/general/add-conditions/>Conditions</a> for more details.</p></li><li>
<p>Under <strong>Action</strong> create one or more actions for the rule by clicking on the <strong>empty field</strong> to add a form or form field, and then choose an option from the action drop-down list, choosing from <strong>Hide</strong>, <strong>Show</strong>, <strong>Disable</strong>, <strong>Enable</strong>, <strong>Toggle visible</strong>, <strong>Toggle enable</strong>, or <strong>Hide and clear</strong>, see <a href=#introduction>Introduction</a> for an explanation of each action.</p><p><img src=/images/hide-example.jpg alt="Hide or disable example - Hide or show"></p><p>For example in the image above, a <strong>Feedback</strong> field will be hidden, using <strong>Hide</strong>, based on a condition, when a field <strong>Management decision</strong> equals a value <strong>&lsquo;Yes&rsquo;</strong>.</p></li><li>
<p>To add more actions, click on <strong>Add</strong>. At any time remove an action by clicking on the <strong>Bin/Trash</strong> icon <img src=/images/bin.png alt="Bin/Trash button"> beside the name of the action.</p></li><li>
<p>Just like an &lsquo;if..else&rsquo; statement, you can add alternative/elsewise actions, based on different conditions by clicking on <strong>Add otherwise action</strong>.</p><p><img src=/images/hide-or-show-example.jpg alt="Hide or show example"></p><p>In the example above, <strong>Signature</strong> and <strong>Training materials</strong> field will show and a <strong>Feedback</strong> field will hide, while a <strong>Management decision</strong> field has a value of <strong>Yes</strong>, otherwise the shown fields will hide, while the <strong>Feedback</strong> field shows <strong>No</strong>. The result is a dynamic form that will reveal particular fields based on user input for the Management decision field.</p></li><li>
<p>To remove the otherwise action(s), click on the <strong>Remove otherwise action</strong> fields.</p></li><li>
<p>When you are finished editing the dialog box, click on <strong>OK</strong> or click on <strong>Close</strong> at any time to exit the dialog box.</p></li><li>
<p>If the rule is attached to a field within a form, a rule notification will appear within the form design, for example a rule is applied to the field <strong>Management decision</strong> as shown in the image below.</p><p><img src=/images/rule-in-form-example.jpg alt="Rule on a form field"></p></li><li>
<p>When you click on the field or form that has the rule attached, the rule will appear in the right-hand pane under <strong>Rules</strong>.</p><p><img src=/images/hide-or-show-rule.jpg alt="Hide or disable rule example"></p><p>The next section will cover how to use the buttons visible in the right-hand pane to manipulate the rule.</p></li></ol><h3 id=editing-deleting-or-duplicating-rules>Editing, deleting or duplicating rules</h3><p>When you have clicked on an existing rule, and the rule is visible in the right-hand pane under <strong>Rules</strong>, there are a number of options available to you.</p><ol>
<li>
<p>To <strong>disable</strong> a rule, click the slider across beside the rule name.</p><p><img src=/images/disable-rule.jpg alt="Disable a rule"></p></li><li>
<p>To <strong>copy</strong> a rule, click on the <strong>Duplicate</strong> button <img src=/images/duplicate-button.jpg alt="Duplicate button"> beside the rule name.</p></li><li>
<p>To <strong>delete</strong> a rule, click on the <strong>Bin/Trash</strong> button <img src=/images/bin.png alt="Bin/Trash button">.</p></li><li>
<p>To <strong>view</strong> a rule, click on the <strong>rule name</strong> to open the <strong>Edit rule</strong> dialog box.</p></li></ol><h3 id=user-tip-target-iconimages05png>User tip <img src=/images/05.png alt="Target icon"></h3><p>Note, it is not necessary to add a condition to the rule. In this case the rule will be triggered automatically:</p><ul>
<li>if the rule is applied to a <em>field</em>, then the rule will be triggered when the user enters a value in that field.</li><li>if the rule is applied to a <em>button</em>, then the rule will be triggered when the user clicks the button.</li><li>if the rule is applied to a <em>form</em>, then the rule will be triggered when the form is submitted.</li><li>if the rule is applied to a <em>process</em>, then the rule will be triggered on load, that is when the process is initiated.</li></ul><p>If a rule causes a mandatory field to be hidden or disabled, this will not stop the form from being submitted.</p><h3 id=whats-next--idea-iconimages18png>What&rsquo;s next <img src=/images/18.png alt="Idea icon"></h3><p>To find out more about other workflow rules go to <a href=/platform/rules/workflow/>Workflow</a>.</p><p>To find out more about other rules go to <a href=/platform/rules/>Rules</a>.</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always>
<h1 id=pg-03be7a0e2c7bf57d90c7dea7dcbb71ee>2.2 - Make required</h1><h2 id=introduction>Introduction</h2><p>The <strong>Make required</strong> rule is used to <strong>dynamically</strong> make form elements required or mandatory for users to fill in, or not required or to toggle between both states.</p><p>It is possible to make fields <strong>statically</strong> mandatory for users to fill in by checking the <strong>Required</strong> property for the field. However using this rule gives a greater degree of flexibility to cause an action based on user input using a <a href=/platform/rules/general/add-conditions/><strong>Condition</strong></a>.</p><p>Take the example of a feedback form, where there is an option for a customer to fill in their name or not. If they do fill in their name however, then a Customer Account Number field becomes mandatory.</p><p><img src=/images/make-required-example.jpg alt="Make required rule example"></p><p>As soon as Maddie fills out her name in the example above, then and only then the Customer Account Number becomes required, indicated by an asterix. This rule could be combined with <a href=/platform/rules/workflow/hide-or-disable/>Hide or Disable</a> rule to make fields appear/hidden based on user input.</p><h2 id=when-to-use>When to use</h2><p>You can add this rule:</p><ul>
<li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> to a field</li></ul><p>The rule can be added at other levels (process, form), but it is most commonly used in the method outlined in the <a href=#introduction>Introduction</a>.</p><h2 id=how-to-get-started>How to get started</h2><p>To dynamically make a field required:</p><ol>
<li>
<p>Click on an existing process by going to <strong>Administration</strong> > <strong>Designer</strong> and decide which form, or field you will apply the rule to, by clicking on that item so that it is in <strong>edit mode</strong> so you can see the Edit/pen button, <strong>Pen</strong> button <img src=/images/penicon.png alt="Pen button">.</p></li><li>

<li>
<p><strong>Select form</strong> - click on the field and select a form from the process.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Display mode</strong> - choose from:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Auto</strong> - the display mode will be either edit or read as determined by the system. If the destination form is the next form in the process workflow, and if the user is an owner of the form, and the form is not completed, then the form will be displayed in edit mode. Otherwise the form will appear in read mode.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Edit mode</strong> - the user will be able to edit the destination form.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Read mode</strong> - the user will be able to read, but not edit, the destination form.</p></li></ul></li><li>
<p><strong>Set as current form</strong> - choose from the radio buttons <strong>Yes</strong> or <strong>No</strong>. If you choose <strong>Yes</strong> this will change the process flow, forcing the selected form to become the current, active form.</p><p><img src=/images/go-to-form-example.jpg alt="Go to form example"></p><p>For example in the image above of an IT Support process, there are a number of forms, one of which is <strong>User Review</strong>. In Kianda Designer, the <strong>Go to form</strong> rule is assigned to a <strong>Resolved</strong> button in the <strong>1st Level Support</strong> form, meaning that the <strong>User Review</strong> form becomes the next active form, not the <strong>2nd Level Support</strong> form although it is the next form in the process workflow.</p></li></ul></li><li>

<p>When the design is chosen, other options will appear in the <strong>Edit rule</strong> dialog box, the <strong>Lookup existing process</strong> option appears, where you can choose <strong>Yes</strong> or <strong>No</strong>.</p><p><img src=/images/lookup-existing-process-yes.jpg alt="Lookup existing process option Yes"></p><ul>
<li>If you choose <strong>No</strong> then that means you are creating a <strong>new process instance</strong> from that process design.</li><li>If you choose <strong>Yes</strong> then that means you are <strong>updating an existing process instance</strong> and you must provide a field containing the target process name. You will also need to <strong>provide</strong> for the existing process instance. This can be done using the <a href=#on-success-mapping><strong>On success mapping</strong></a> section, see below.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>
<p>An <a href=#input-mapping>Input mapping</a> section allows you to map values for fields from the primary process to the secondary/target process fields, read more below.</p></li><li>
<p>A <a href=#table-mapping>Table mapping</a> section allows you to map values from a table(s) in the primary process to the secondary/target process table(s), see below.</p></li><li>
<p>Use <a href=#on-success-mapping>On success mapping</a> to retrieve values from the secondary process, showing success in process execution. Click on the link to read more.</p><p><img src=/images/lookup-existing-process.jpg alt="Edit rule dialog box options"></p></li><li>

<p>Click <strong>OK</strong> when you are finished editing the dialog box, or <strong>Close</strong> at any time to exit the dialog box.</p></li></ol><h3 id=input-mapping>Input mapping</h3><p>For Input mapping you can map field values from one process to another. For example in an &lsquo;Onboarding HR process&rsquo;, if a user fills out their name in a <strong>Name</strong> field, then that name/value will be mapped to a field in a form in the secondary/target process &lsquo;Send email process&rsquo; called <strong>New request Name</strong> as shown in the example below. Your forms must already have precreated fields to capture the values from process or user input.</p><p><img src=/images/input-mapping-example.jpg alt="Input mapping example"></p><p>To use <strong>Input mapping,</strong> click on the blue bar for <strong>Input mapping</strong>:</p><ol>
<li>
<p>The process names will automatically appear in the left and right columns once a process design is selected from the drop-down list, see step 5 in <a href=#how-to-get-started>How to get started</a> above. Within each field, choose a <strong>form</strong> and <strong>then a field</strong> that you would like to map the values from one process to another. Alternatively, you can <strong>type in text</strong> to pass from the primary process to a field in the secondary process.</p></li><li>

<li>
<p><strong>Copy rows</strong> which allows you to copy row data from one process to another. You can also add conditions to the copying process by clicking on <strong>Copy row conditions</strong> to allow you to have conditions on which rows are copied over to the target process. We can add fields or text to the conditions. Click on <a href=/platform/rules/general/add-conditions/>Conditions</a> to read more about conditions in Kianda.</p><p>If you click on the <strong>Action</strong> button <img src=/images/action-button.jpg alt="Action button"> then column titles from the primary and secondary processes are automatically listed under <strong>Column mapping</strong> as shown below, where <strong>Need</strong> and <strong>Reason</strong> are column headings in the table in the primary process and <strong>Customer need</strong> and <strong>Reason given</strong> are column headings in the table in the secondary/target process. In the example below, a condition has been set so that if <strong>Need</strong> equals the text &lsquo;Broadband connection&rsquo; then the values input into the columns listed will be copied over.</p><p><img src=/images/table-mappings-example.jpg alt="Table mappings example"></p></li><li>
<p><strong>Update rows</strong> - if you choose <strong>Update rows</strong> then contents of the target process table will be updated. Similar to copy rows, an <strong>Update row conditions</strong> button appears allowing you to set conditions for what content is updated. As with <strong>Copy row conditions</strong> you can set <a href=/platform/rules/general/add-conditions/>conditions</a> to control how values are mapped from one process to another.</p><p>An <strong>Action</strong> button <img src=/images/action-button.jpg alt="Action button"> is available beside <strong>Column mapping</strong> to allow you to autofill field names from processes under <strong>Field or text</strong> and <strong>To table</strong> fields.</p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>

<p>Click on the <strong>Add table mapping</strong> button to add more tables.</p></li></ol><h3 id=on-success-mapping>On success mapping</h3><p>If you wish to <strong>update an existing process instance</strong> you can use mapping within the <strong>On success mapping</strong> section to retrieve the <strong>Process ID</strong> of that process instance, and then trigger rules in the target process instance. A <strong>text box</strong> field within the form can be created to hold the Process ID value, see <a href=#before-getting-started>Before getting started</a>. The ID for the existing process instance, is one of the <a href=/platform/application-designer/process/common-fields/>Common fields</a> that can be pulled from the system.</p><p>To use On success mapping:</p><ol>
<li>
<p>Click on the green bar of <strong>On success mapping</strong> to reveal primary and secondary/target process form fields. For example in the image below, the primary process is called <strong>Onboarding HR</strong> and the secondary process is called <strong>Send email process</strong>. Both of these appear automatically below when the green bar is clicked on.</p><ul>
<li>From here you can choose to add in form fields, for example a text box field called <strong>Sales Onboarding Process ID</strong> that will hold a common field <strong>Process ID</strong> from the target process.</li></ul><p><img src=/images/success-mapping-start-rule.jpg alt="On success mapping options"></p><ul>
<li>Click on the <strong>Bin/Trash</strong> button <img src=/images/binicon.png alt="Bin button"> to delete a mapping.</li><li>Click on the <strong>Add mapping</strong> button <img src=/images/add-mapping-button.jpg alt="Add mapping button"> to add further mappings from the secondary/target process to the primary process. Ensure that form fields are already precreated to hold these values.</li></ul></li><li>
<p>Further options exist under this section, starting with <strong>Trigger rules in target instance</strong> allowing you to kick off business rules enabling actions in the target process. Options are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>No</strong> where triggering rules is disabled, and no further options appear.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Yes</strong> where triggering rules is enabled, and further options appear:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Select a field or rule to trigger on target process</strong> - clicking on this field allows you to choose a <strong>form</strong> from the target process and from there you can drill down to a <strong>field</strong> to trigger <strong>all the rules</strong> attached to that field, or drill down to a particular <strong>rule</strong> so that only that rule will be triggered as shown in the example below.</p><p><img src=/images/trigger-rule-target-process.jpg alt="Trigger rule target process"></p><p>If you want to <strong>save values passed</strong> under <a href=#input-mapping>Input mapping</a> then trigger the <strong>Save</strong> button (that contains the <strong>Save process</strong> and <strong>Close</strong> rules) found by default in all Kianda forms.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Enable real-time rule execution</strong>? - options are <strong>Yes</strong> or <strong>No</strong>. If you choose <strong>Yes</strong>, rules in the secondary/target process instance will trigger without any delay in the server. If you choose <strong>No</strong> then a second option becomes available to allow you to choose to <strong>Execute in series?</strong></p><p><img src=/images/rule-execution-options.jpg alt="Rule execution options"></p><ul>
<li><strong>Execute in series</strong>? - options are <strong>Yes</strong> or <strong>No</strong>. If you choose <strong>No</strong> then the server side execution of rules will happen in series or in sequence, instead of in parallel. In series or in sequence refers to synchronous execution, where a rule will only execute when the previous rule has completed. In parallel refers to asynchronous execution whereby rules execute without waiting for the previous rule to finish. This type of execution is useful when rules are not dependent on each other, for example the output of one rule is not used as input for another.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>

<h1 id=pg-74b10c5e2e6f837732e8c3f2dd7591ca>2.7 - Schedule a rule</h1><h2 id=introduction>Introduction</h2><p><strong>Schedule a rule</strong> allows you to schedule a rule or a field to be triggered <strong>immediately</strong>, at some <strong>point in the future</strong> or <strong>recurring</strong>. If a form field has <strong>multiple</strong> rules attached to it, that include the <strong>Schedule a rule</strong> rule, rules can execute sequentially and you can change the order of the rule execution, see <a href=/platform/rules/general/multiple-rules/>Multiple rules</a> for details. You can also select a specific rule to execute. For example in the image below, the text box field <strong>First Name</strong> is expanded to show two rules. You can select all or just one rule to be triggered. You can select all rules by selecting the <strong>First Name</strong> text box itself or to select just one rule you can expand the field and selecting the desired rule you want to schedule:</p><p><img src=/images/schedule-rule-single-rule.jpg alt="Selecting one rule to be triggered"></p><h2 id=when-to-use>When to use</h2><p>You can add this rule:</p><ul>
<li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> to a field</li><li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> to a form</li><li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> to a process (the rule will run on load)</li></ul><h2 id=how-to-get-started>How to get started</h2><p>The following step illustrates a scenario to schedule a reminder email using the <a href=/platform/rules/communications/send-email/>Send email rule</a> when a form is submitted:</p><ol>
<li>
<p>Click on an existing process by going to <strong>Administration</strong> > <strong>Designer</strong> and decide which form, or field you will apply the rule to, by clicking on that item so that it is in <strong>edit mode</strong> so you can see the Edit/pen button, <strong>Pen</strong> button <img src=/images/penicon.png alt="Pen button">.</p></li><li>
<p>Click on <strong>Add a rule</strong> > <strong>Workflow</strong> > <strong>Schedule a rule</strong>.</p></li><li>
<p>In the <strong>Edit rule - Schedule a rule</strong> dialog box, give the rule a title in the <strong>Title</strong> field.</p><p><img src=/images/schedule-rule-details.jpg alt="Go to form rule"></p></li><li>
<p>If you want to add conditions for the rule, click on the <strong>Edit conditions</strong> button <img src=/images/editconditions.png alt="Edit conditions button"> to create conditions for the rule, see <a href=/platform/rules/general/add-conditions/>Conditions</a> for more details.</p></li><li>
<p>Under <strong>Action</strong> fill out the following:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Select the field or rule to trigger on schedule</strong> - allows you to select a field or rule you want to trigger. If a field has multiple rules, they will be triggered sequentially and you can change the order of the rule execution, see <a href=/platform/rules/general/multiple-rules/>Multiple rules</a> for details. You can also select a specific rule from a field with multiple rules by drilling down and selecting the desired rule. In this example we want to select a rule called <strong>Send email</strong> which is attached to the <strong>Submit</strong> button.</p><p><img src=/images/schedule-rule-send-email.jpg alt="Schedule a send email rule"></p></li><li>
<p><strong>Schedule</strong> - allows you to choose a time of schedule. For this example we will select to send the email <strong>Weekly</strong> at 10 am every 2 weeks.</p><p><img src=/images/schedule-rule-weekly.jpg alt="Schedule a send email rule"></p><p>You can select a different type of schedule that is suited to your rule, here are the options:</p><ul>
<li><strong>One time</strong> - Select <strong>Time mode</strong> as <strong>Absolute</strong> or <strong>Relative</strong> from now. If <strong>Absolute</strong>, you can select the time using the clock icon and the date using the calendar icon or you can select a form field (where the date is stored) by clicking on the icon with black discs <img src=/images/icon-blackdisks.jpg alt=Disks>. If <strong>Relative</strong> from now, enter the days, hours and minutes directly.</li><li><strong>Minutes</strong> - select the number of minutes you want the scheduled rule to reoccur.</li><li><strong>Hourly</strong> - select the number of minutes and hours you want the scheduled rule to reoccur.</li><li><strong>Daily</strong> - select the time of day and the number of days you want the scheduled rule to reoccur. You can select that the rule will trigger only on week days by enabling the <strong>Week days only</strong> checkbox.</li><li><strong>Weekly</strong> - select a day of the week, time of the day and the number of weeks that you want the scheduled rule to reoccur.</li><li><strong>Monthly</strong> - select the date of the month or <strong>First, Second, Third, Fourth, Last</strong> weekday of the month. You can also select a specific time that you want the scheduled rule to reoccur.</li><li><strong>Immediately</strong> - the rule will trigger immediately.</li></ul></li><li>
<p><strong>Expire</strong> - It is possible to set the schedule rule to expire by enabling <strong>Expire</strong> checkbox. For this example we will use the <strong>When</strong> option and apply a condition. The goal of the reminder is to send it every two weeks until the status of the process is completed. In the <strong>condition</strong> of the <strong>When</strong> option, select <strong>Status</strong> from the <a href=/platform/application-designer/process/common-fields/>Common fields</a> and make it <strong>equals</strong> to <strong>completed</strong> as shown in the image below:</p><p><img src=/images/schedule-rule-status.jpg alt="Schedule a send email rule"></p><p>There are three options when to expire the scheduled rule:</p><ul>
<li><strong>By</strong> - the rule will expire by the date and time given. Either select the time using the clock icon and the date using the calendar icon OR select a form field (where the date is stored) by clicking on the icon with black discs.</li><li><strong>After</strong> - the rule will expire after a set number of occurrences. Select the number of occurrences in the blank field or click on the icon with black discs to choose a field where the number of occurrences is stored.</li><li><strong>When</strong> - add a condition which will cause the rule to expire when it is true.</li></ul></li></ul><p>You are also presented with <strong>two more options</strong> when selecting any of the <strong>Schedule</strong> options except <strong>Immediately</strong>, the options are:</p><p><img src=/images/schedule-rule-extra-options.jpg alt="Extra options for the schedule a rule"></p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Make task unique</strong> - enable this option to prevent a second identical task being created for this instance of the process</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Execute in series</strong> - select <strong>Yes</strong> if you want the server-side execution to be in series rather than in parallel.</p></li></ul></li><li>

Implementing this rule will result in a new item in the <strong>user notification</strong> in the <a href=/platform/general/quickaction/><strong>Quick action menu</strong></a>, for example a rule that alerts a user to complete a form. The user notification icon will look like this when the alert comes in, indicating there is one new notification: <img src=/images/user-notification-new-item.jpg alt="New user notification"></p><p>Clicking on the notification icon, opens up a pop-up box with the notification, for example:</p><p><img src=/images/user-alert-example.jpg alt="User alert example to complete a form"></p><p>Clicking on the Reminder itself will bring the user to that form within the process instance, for the user to complete.</p><p>Depending on how you configure the alert, you can create an alert message which appears as a warning in a user&rsquo;s workspace as shown in the image below.</p><p><img src=/images/user-alert-warning2.jpg alt="user alert warning"></p><h2 id=getting-started-with-communication-rules>Getting started with Communication rules</h2><p>If you go to <strong>Administration</strong> > <strong>Designer</strong> and click on a process or create a new process, then click on <strong>Add a rule</strong> the <strong>Communication</strong> rules are found in the left-hand pane when you click on <strong>Communications</strong>.</p><p><img src=/images/communication-rules-all.jpg alt="Communication rules"></p><p>There are four types of <strong>Communication</strong> rules as follows:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Send email</strong> - This rule allows you to send automated emails that contain images, text, process and other links and attachments. Email templates are defined within the rule, allowing you to style emails the way you want and use <a href=/platform/rules/general/expression-builder/>Expressions</a> to automate the process. You can map fields and content from within the process, for example using a userpicker field so that user input in a form determines who an email is sent to. Emails can be sent out using a predefined SMTP connector, see <a href=/platform/connectors/email/#setting-up-a-global-smtp-mail-connector>Setting up a Global SMTP mail Connector</a> for more details.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Meeting request</strong> - This rule is similar to the <strong>Send email</strong> rule and allows you to send automated specially formatted emails that contain a meeting request.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Anonymous form link</strong> - This rule creates an anonymous link to a form which can be sent to external users who do not need Kianda login details or accounts to access the form(s), for example contractors or third party providers. The receivers of the link can then simply click on the link and submit data back to a process instance in Kianda.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>User alert</strong> - This rule sends an alert to a user which appears in the user notifications in the top right-hand quick actions menu bar. See <a href=/platform/general/quickaction/>Quick action menu</a> for an introduction to the shortcuts available to users including notifications. You can configure the alert to appear the way you want for example to allow warning messages to appear as shown in the image in the <a href=#introduction>Introduction</a> or to link to a form for a user to complete.</p></li></ul><h3 id=whats-next--idea-iconimages18png>What&rsquo;s next <img src=/images/18.png alt="Idea icon"></h3><p>To read more about each of the rule types go to the links below:</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always>

The body of the email can include text, images and attachments. Data stored in fields in the current form can be copied in dynamically.</p><h2 id=when-to-use-the-send-email-rule>When to use the Send email rule</h2><p>You can add this rule:</p><ul>
<li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> to a field</li><li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> to a form</li><li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> to a process (the rule will run on load)</li></ul><h2 id=before-you-get-started>Before you get started</h2><p>In advance of using this rule, you need to have <strong>created one or more forms, complete with control fields</strong>. For example a text box control with an employee&rsquo;s &lsquo;Name&rsquo; may be part of a form &lsquo;Annual Leave Request&rsquo;. Then this &lsquo;Name&rsquo; field can be used as an <strong>expression</strong> in the email to send personalised emails, so these aspects must be set up in advance.</p><ol>
<li>Decide how the rule will be implemented, for example will an email be sent once a form is saved or submitted. In the example of form submit, then click on that form in the process > <strong>Submit</strong> button > <strong>Add a rule</strong> > <strong>Send email</strong>.</li><li>Decide who the automated email will be sent from, for example a no-reply type email. If you leave the From field empty, the email will be sent from <a href=mailto:noreply@kianda.com>noreply@kianda.com</a>. If you want your email to come from a different sender, then go to <a href=/platform/rules/communications/send-email/#email-connector>Email connector</a> for more details on how to set that up.</li><li>Any email addresses to send To, From, CC or BCC must be set up in advance. This could be a textbox in a form called &lsquo;Email address&rsquo; with a unique Name like &rsquo;emailAddress&rsquo;, or it could be a user picker field associated with particular users, groups or partners.</li><li>If you want to track the emails, then you must set up a field in your form to store email tracking.</li><li>If you want to attach any files to an email, files must first be stored in a File field in one of the forms.</li></ol><h2 id=how-to-get-started>How to get started</h2><ol>

<h1 id=pg-53eadd5772a2acfb0d62d216c8f383cc>3.2 - Meeting request</h1><p>The <strong>Meeting request</strong> rule sends an email according to a predefined template. It works exactly like the <a href=/platform/rules/communications/send-email/>Send email</a> rule with three additional fields to which are used to set up the date and time of the meeting. The three additional fields are as follow:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Start time</strong> - indicating the starting date and time of the meeting.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>End time</strong> - indicating the ending date and time of the meeting.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Location</strong> - indicating the location of the meeting.</p><p><img src=/images/meeting-request-fields.jpg alt></p></li></ul><p>If you are using an email connector, a meeting request will appear in the calendar of the receiver(s). Otherwise the meeting request will appear as a calendar file (.ics file type) attached to an email. to learn more about email connector go to <a href=/platform/connectors/email/>Email connector</a>.</p><h2 id=when-to-use>When to use</h2><p>You can add this rule:</p><ul>
<li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> to a field</li><li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> to a form</li><li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> to a process (the rule will run on load)</li></ul><h2 id=before-you-get-started>Before you get started</h2><p>In advance of using this rule, you need to have <strong>created one or more forms, complete with control fields</strong>. For example a <a href=/platform/controls/input/textbox/>Text box control</a> with an employee’s ‘Name’ may be part of a form ‘Meeting request’. Then this ‘Name’ field can be used as an <strong>expression</strong> in the email to send personalised emails, so these aspects must be set up in advance. The Meeting request rule must also contain three specific fields which are the <a href=/platform/controls/input/date/>Date control</a> for both the <strong>Start</strong> and <strong>End</strong> time fields, as well as textbox control or a <a href=/platform/controls/input/list/>List control</a> a field for the <strong>Location</strong>.</p><ol>
<li>Decide how the rule will be implemented, for example will an email be sent once a form is saved or submitted. In the example of form submit, then click on that form in the process > <strong>Submit</strong> button > <strong>Add a rule</strong> > <strong>Send email</strong>.</li><li>Decide who the automated email will be sent from, for example a no-reply type email. If you leave the From field empty, the email will be sent from <a href=mailto:noreply@kianda.com>noreply@kianda.com</a>. If you want your email to come from a different sender, then go to <a href=http://localhost:1313/platform/rules/communications/send-email/#email-connector>Email connector</a> for more details on how to set that up.</li><li>Any email addresses to send To, From, CC or BCC must be set up in advance. This could be a textbox in a form called ‘Email address’ with a unique Name like ’emailAddress’, or it could be a user picker field associated with particular users, groups or partners.</li><li>If you want to track the emails, then you must set up a field in your form to store email tracking.</li><li>If you want to attach any files to an email, files must first be stored in a File field in one of the forms.</li></ol><blockquote>
<p>Note; the start and end time fields are both required on the request meeting rule therefore you should make the start and end fields required on your form too.

<li>
<p><strong>Create item</strong> - The create item rule is used to create an item on your data connection. This is a straightforward rule which allows you to connect to your data source and map inputs. You can also map a data source field or text back to Kianda on success or store an error message on failure.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Delete item</strong> - To delete an item from your data connection, you could use a data source filter and map data source field or text from a data connection to Kianda form field.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Update item</strong> - This rule works in the same way as the Delete item rule. At any point, if you would like to update any item on your data connection, use this rule. To find an item to update, you could use a data source filter and map the input fields or text.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Find items</strong> - Use this rule together with a datasource to perform a query and return data for use with the form. To find an item, you could use a data source filter which acts as a conditional bridge between Kianda and data-connections. If the condition is true, you could map the data source field or text to the Kianda form field.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Set form field</strong> - This rule is used to update the value of fields in a form. The field value could be simple text or based on a custom expression with the ability to define JavaScript expressions. Use this rule to copy content between fields or to apply a custom expression to set the value of a given field.</p></li></ul><h3 id=whats-next--idea-iconimages18png>What&rsquo;s next <img src=/images/18.png alt="Idea icon"></h3><p>We have briefly introduced each of the five types of <strong>Data rules</strong>.

The rule will read one or more items of data from a chosen data source, for example SharePoint, SAP or Oracle databases, see <a href=/platform/connectors/>Data connectors</a> for more details.</p><p>The <strong>Data source filter</strong> in this rule is used for targeting specific data item in your data connection. The item you want to update within your data source is targeted by filtering it out using a field within your form. It is a good idea to connect a dummy field to your data source first and then use that field to filter for the item you want to update. The actual value used to update the item in your data source can also use a field or text filled out in your mapping section (see below for more detail). To make your <strong>Update item</strong> rule extremely dynamic, it is recommended to create field for filtering an item and a separate field for the new value you want your item to hold.</p><h2 id=when-to-use>When to use</h2><p>The Update item rule should be used whenever you want to update an existing item within a data source of your choice.</p><p>You can add this rule:</p><ul>

<h1 id=pg-de4bdabf10262e3207fc78806630e2a0>5 - User rules</h1><h2 id=introduction>Introduction</h2><p><strong>User rules</strong> is one of the category of <a href=/platform/rules/>rules</a> available in Kianda, that enables user-based operations associated with user <strong>properties</strong>, for example <strong>updating</strong> a user property, <strong>retrieving</strong> a user property and <strong>finding</strong> a user based on a property. The user rules also allow you to <strong>invite partners</strong> and <strong>share</strong> a particular process with them. These rules are very useful when you want to do any property actions on a user like find a user or update a property of a specific user.</p><p>Take an example of a <strong>Look up user by property</strong> rule. Implementing this rule will allow you to store a user in a <strong>User picker</strong> field by providing a property of a user, for example user role or email address. See image below when a location is being chosen, a trainer is found that is assigned to the location:</p><p><img src=/images/lookup-user-location.jpg alt="User rules"></p><p>In this example the <strong>Location of training</strong> is a <strong>List</strong> control is connected to a <strong>SQL Server connector</strong>. The Display field, Value field and Sort by of the List control is set to <strong>Location</strong>. With the list control set up that way, we are provided with a list based on our Location column in the database. For more information on how to create a List control and set its datasource go to <a href=/platform/controls/input/list/>List control</a>. See image below to see how the <strong>Location of training</strong> field is set up:</p><p><img src=/images/users-list-control-example.jpg alt="User rules"></p><p>With all of our users, we have set up a <strong>Location property</strong> and each user is assigned a different locations based on where they operate and provide training. The <strong>lookup user by property</strong> is set to <strong>Location</strong> which we provide to the rule by selecting our <strong>Location of training</strong> field. The outcome of this combination will set our <strong>Trainer</strong> field with the user that the <strong>Location property</strong> matches the value specified in the <strong>Location of training</strong> field. To learn more about how to create your own user properties and attributes go to <a href=/platform/administration/users/#modify-profile-attributes>Modifying profile attributes</a>. See image below of the Lookup user by property rule:</p><p><img src=/images/users-lookup.jpg alt="User rules"></p><p>For example when a user selects <strong>Galway</strong> from the <strong>Location of training</strong>, the lookup rule will search for a user that has the location property set to Galway and the result is <strong>Mark Lycette</strong>.

<h1 id=pg-90b20164e3c4ac39a8da65ede0441b36>5.3 - Invite partner</h1><h2 id=introduction>Introduction</h2><p>The <strong>Invite partner</strong> rule allows you to <strong>dynamically</strong> send out an email to a partner organisation with an <strong>invitation</strong> to <strong>share</strong> a process from your subscription. This rule <strong>creates a profile</strong> for the partner as well as shares a process specified in the rule. You can choose to <strong>generate</strong> an invite link and store the link in a text box field if needed instead of sending out an automatic email.</p><h2 id=when-to-use>When to use</h2><p>Use this rule when inviting a <strong>third-party organisation</strong> from within a process instance, for example when your company must hire a third-party organisation to complete a specific task from your process, you can share this process with the third-party organisation to complete the task. Take a <strong>maintenance</strong> company for example, a process is created to perform a maintenance check. The maintenance company performs a check but some broken parts need to be re-manufactured, therefore the maintenance company sends out a <strong>Partner invitation</strong> to the <strong>manufacturing</strong> company in order to manufacture missing or broken parts as the maintenance company makes checks and fixes but not manufacture parts.</p><p>You can add this rule:</p><ul>
<li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> to a field</li><li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> to a form</li><li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> to a process (the rule will run on load)</li></ul><h2 id=before-getting-started>Before getting started</h2><p>Before you get started with this rule, you need to create a <strong>shared process instance</strong> of the process you intend to share with the partner. To learn more how to create a shared process instance, go to <a href=/platform/b2b-portals/shared-process/>Shared processes</a>.</p><p>In advance of using the <strong>Invite partner</strong> rule, in your process you need to have created at least one or more forms. The <strong>Invite partner</strong> rule also requires you to create a list of fields that are used to hold information about the partner and which process you want to share. See below for the list of fields required in your process before using the invite partner rule:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Partner organisation</strong> - text box field representing the name of the organisation that the partner is part of.</li><li><strong>Shared process name</strong> - text box field representing the name of the process you want to share.</li><li><strong>Contact first name</strong> - text box field representing the first name of the partner you want to share a process with.</li><li><strong>Contact last name</strong> - text box field representing the last name of the partner you want to share a process with.</li><li><strong>Contact email</strong> - text box field representing the email address of the partner you want to share a process with.</li><li><strong>Partner country</strong> - text box field representing the country that your partner is situated in.</li><li><strong>Partner city</strong> - text box field representing the city that your partner is in.</li></ul><h2 id=how-to-get-started>How to get started</h2><ol>

<h1 id=pg-644f257727736f5e222c9441240ef24a>6 - File management rules</h1><p><strong>File management</strong> rules is one category of <a href=/platform/rules/>rules</a> to enable operations such as the generation of Word documents, conversion to PDF format and merging PDF files together. These operations are useful when creating Word/Excel where the structure of those documents is the same for every instance but values are different. You can also use the <strong>File management</strong> rules for creating anonymous links which give access to files without permissions.</p><p>Take an example of a <strong>Create a file anonymous link</strong> rule. Implementing this rule will result in a <strong>randomly generated link</strong> which will lead to a file that you want to share. This link can be opened in <strong>any browser</strong> and can be <strong>accessible</strong> by anyone and there is <strong>no need for authentication</strong> when opening the link. You can also set the expiry time of the created link which will cause the link not to exist after the specified time. See images below for an example of the <strong>Create a file anonymous link</strong> rule:</p><p><img src=/images/file-managemt-rules-example.jpg alt="File management rules"></p><h2 id=getting-started-with-file-management-rules>Getting started with File management rules</h2><p>If you go to <strong>Administration</strong> > <strong>Designer</strong> and click on a process or create a new process, then click on <strong>Add a rule</strong> the <strong>File management</strong> rules are found in the left-hand pane when you click on <strong>File management</strong>.</p><p><img src=/images/file-managemt-rules.jpg alt="File management rules"></p><p>There are seven types of <strong>File management</strong> rules as follows:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Copy file</strong> - allows copying files between datasources. Use this file together with two file fields to move files between two different file locations. For example to copy files between an on premises folder and a SharePoint folder.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Convert to PDF</strong> - this rule allows the conversation of DOCX and DOC files into PDF format.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Generate word document</strong> - this rule generates a Word document from data associated with a process instance using a user-designed template.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Generate excel document</strong> - this rule generates an Excel workbook from data associated with a process instance using a user-designed template.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Set existing file</strong> - this rule is used to make an existing file accessible by a link, available within a configured file field. For example when you have access to a file through a link, you can use this link to store the file in a file field within your process.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Merge PDF</strong> - this rule allows you to merge two or more PDF files into a single PDF file. It also allows you to merge image file such as PNG or JPG to an existing PDF file.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Create a file anonymous link</strong> - this rule generates file links that can be shared anonymously with external users.

<h1 id=pg-aebb8e0e95503bec0b5f22cb92d32315>7 - Table rules</h1><p><strong>Table</strong> rules is one category of <a href=/platform/rules/>rules</a> to enable table operations such as sorting, copying table rows to another table, exporting and importing table data as .csv files and adding and removing table rows. These operations are useful to implement in external data sources, automating actions using Kianda processes.</p><p>Take an example of a <strong>Sort table</strong> rule. Implementing this rule will result in a table being sorted in an <strong>ascending</strong> or <strong>descending</strong> manner depending on what column of the table you want to sort by. For an example, take the image below as your table.</p><p><img src=/images/table-rules-table-example.jpg alt="Example table"></p><p>You can attach the <strong>Sort table</strong> rule to a button and selecting one of the columns available, for example <strong>Total Price</strong>, and the order of sorting for example <strong>descending</strong>. The result of the table after sorting will look as follows:</p><p><img src=/images/table-rules-result-table.jpg alt="Example table"></p><h2 id=getting-started-with-table-rules>Getting started with Table rules</h2><p>If you go to <strong>Administration</strong> > <strong>Designer</strong> and click on a process or create a new process, then click on <strong>Add a rule</strong>, the <strong>Table</strong> rules are found in the left-hand pane when you click on <strong>Tables</strong>.</p><p><img src=/images/table-rules-all.jpg alt="Table rules"></p><p>There are 12 types of Table rules as follows:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Loop table</strong> - this rule loops through table rows, where other rules can be triggered and implemented.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Add table row</strong> - this rule adds a new row to a table.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Remove table row</strong> - this rule removes a current row from a table.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Import CSV</strong> - this rule imports .csv or .xlsx file data into a table, based on mapping provided within the rule.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Export CSV</strong> - this rule is export the contents of a table to a .csv file.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Copy table rows</strong> - this rule copies table rows from one table to another.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Clear table rows</strong> - this rule removes table rows that match given criteria.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Lookup value from table</strong> - this rule performs a lookup on a table value that match given criteria</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Update table values</strong> -this rule updates table columns that match given criteria.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Sort table</strong> -this rule sorts table data based on multiple conditions.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Aggregate table</strong> - this rule aggregates table values.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Hide/Show column</strong> - this rule allows you to hide or show columns within a table</p></li></ul><h3 id=whats-next--idea-iconimages18png>What&rsquo;s next <img src=/images/18.png alt="Idea icon"></h3><p>To read more about each of the rule types go to the links below:</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always>
<h1 id=pg-9973ef05fb5dbf2f133fc2aa8953281d>7.1 - Loop table</h1><h2 id=introduction>Introduction</h2><p>The <strong>Loop table</strong> rule allows you to loop through table rows within a table of choice from within your process. When selected the rule allows you to trigger fields or rules to perform a particular action within the specified table. For example if a button is added to the table with an associated action, you can then trigger that action while looping through the table.</p><p>For example in the table below, there is a <strong>Calculate total</strong> button in a Calculate total column. This button has a rule that will set a value in the field in the <strong>Total</strong> column. Using the <strong>Loop table</strong> rule every row is looped through and this <strong>Calculate total</strong> button rule is triggered, completing the fields for each row in the <strong>Total</strong> column.</p><p><img src=/images/loop-table-purchase-table.jpg alt="Edit rule - purchase table"></p><p>If the <strong>Loop table</strong> rule isn&rsquo;t used, the user has to manually click on the <strong>Calculate Total</strong> button for each row, to populate the field in the <strong>Total</strong> column.</p><h2 id=when-to-use>When to use</h2><p>This rule is often used when the same action must be performed for multiple rows within a table.</p><p>You can add this rule:</p><ul>

To learn more on how to add a table into your form go to In the table we will have the following columns:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Item</strong> - text box field representing the name of the item bought. To learn how to add a text box field go to <a href=/platform/controls/input/textbox/>Text box control</a>.</p></li><li>

<h1 id=pg-e72bca9c188ab3baf48f4d1e42e82500>7.4 - Import CSV or Excel into Table</h1><h2 id=introduction>Introduction</h2><p>The <strong>Import CSV</strong> rule allows you import a Comma-Separated Values (CSV) file and populate a specified table within your process. Using this rule automates and speeds up the process of populating a table when a lot of data is present. CSV files may look different depending on what program you will open it with, here is an example of a CSV file opened with <strong>Excel</strong>:</p><p><img src=/images/csv-file-excel.jpg alt="CSV file - excel"></p><p>Here is the same file opened using <strong>Notepad</strong>:</p><p><img src=/images/csv-file-notepad.jpg alt="CSV file - notepad"></p><p>As shown in the two images above, the format changes depending on what <strong>program</strong> you <strong>open</strong> the file with. Using the <strong>Notepad</strong>, each column is <strong>separated</strong> with a <strong>comma</strong> and <strong>each new line is a row</strong>. <strong>Excel</strong> formats commas and new lines automatically and creates <strong>numbers for rows</strong> and <strong>letters for columns</strong>. The CSV file can be separated using <strong>different separators</strong> other than comma. For example you can use <code>;</code> as a separator, keep in mind that <strong>Excel</strong> does <strong>not format non-comma separated values correctly</strong> and the file will look as follows when opened using <strong>Excel</strong>:</p><p><img src=/images/import-csv-semicolon.jpg alt="CSV file - excel"></p><p>Here is the same file opened using <strong>Notepad</strong>:</p><p><img src=/images/csv-file-notepad-semicolon.jpg alt="CSV file - excel"></p><h2 id=when-to-use>When to use</h2><p>You can use this rule to populate a table when there is a lot of data present in a CSV file. Apply this rule to a process so that your table is populated <strong>automatically</strong> when a process has been loaded.</p><p>You can add this rule:</p><ul>
<li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> to a field</li><li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> to a form</li><li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> to a process (the rule will run on load)</li></ul><h2 id=before-you-get-started>Before you get started</h2><p>For this rule to work there are a couple of prerequisites needed inside of your process:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Table</strong> - needed to let the rule know which table will be populated using the csv file, for more detail on how to add a table go to <a href=/platform/controls/input/table/>Table control</a>.</li><li><strong>File</strong> - needed as a container to hold your csv file. Using a file control, you can upload a csv file and use that csv file to populate a table. For more detail on how to add a file go to <a href=/platform/controls/input/file-upload/>File upload control</a>.</li></ul><p>Keep in mind that in order to populate a table within your process correctly, you need to have the <strong>same amount of columns</strong> in the table as inside of the CSV file. For example a table looking as follows:</p><p><img src=/images/import-csv-table.jpg alt="Import CSV rule - Sample table"></p><p>This indicates that the CSV file that we want to import should have three columns:</p><p><img src=/images/import-csv-file.jpg alt="CSV file"></p><h2 id=how-to-get-started>How to get started</h2><ol>
<li>
<p>Click on an existing process by going to <strong>Administration</strong> > <strong>Designer</strong> and decide which form, or field you will apply the rule to, by clicking on that item so that it is in <strong>edit mode</strong> so you can see the Edit/pen button, <strong>Pen</strong> button <img src=/images/penicon.png alt="Pen button">.</p></li><li>
<p>Click on <strong>Add a rule</strong> > <strong>Table</strong> > <strong>Import CSV</strong>.</p></li><li>

<p>If you want to add conditions for the rule, click on the <strong>Edit conditions</strong> button <img src=/images/editconditions.png alt="Edit conditions button"> see <a href=/platform/rules/general/add-conditions/>Conditions</a> for more details.</p></li><li>
<p>Under the <strong>Action</strong> section fill out the following:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Select the CSV file field</strong> - select a file field containing a csv file. This file field needs to be <strong>pre-created</strong> as it is a required field when using this rule. the csv file attached to this field will be used to populate the table.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>CSV separator</strong> - the default separator is a comma ( <strong>,</strong> ) but you can set it to any character, number or symbol you want. Keep in mind that the separator fields separates each column of a row. For example you can have a file that looks as follows:</p><p><em>This image represents how a table looks like applying the Import CSV rule with a sample file and when the CSV separator is set to a comma ( <strong>,</strong> ) see below:</em></p><p><img src=/images/import-csv-comma.jpg alt="Comma separated CSV file"></p></li><li>
<p><strong>Num cols. in CSV</strong> - this field represents the number of columns in your CSV file. From the example and image above, this field is set to three.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Skip first line</strong> - radio button asking whether to skip the first line or add the first line of the CSV file. If the first line of your CSV file represents the title of the column, you can select <strong>Yes</strong> and the line will not be included in your table.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Destination table</strong> - field that allows you to select the table you want to target when populating data from the CSV file. New mapping options are presented when selecting a table.</p><p><img src=/images/import-csv-mapping.jpg alt="Import CSV mapping options"></p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Table row field</strong> - select the row you want to target when setting a value.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>CSV field or text</strong> - you can select a field/column within your CSV file or type in text manually to represent the value you want your field to contain.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Add mapping</strong> - you can choose to assign values to multiple fields in your row by clicking on <strong>Add mapping</strong> button. You can also remove fields by clicking on the <strong>Bin/Trash</strong> icon <img src=/images/bin.png alt="Bin/Trash button">.</p><p>Going back to the CSV separator example image, to achieve the correct mapping, we need to add three fields as shown below:</p><p><img src=/images/import-csv-mapping-fields.jpg alt="Import CSV mapping options"></p></li></ul></li><li>
<p><strong>Existing rows behavior</strong> - you have two options when populating data into your selected table:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Override</strong> - will override all existing rows of your table with the new data from your CSV file.</li><li><strong>Append</strong> - will ignore the existing rows inside of your table and simply append all the new rows from your CSV file to the end of the table.</li></ul></li><li>
<p><strong>CSV Date format</strong> - type in manually the data format that you have set in your CSV file. This applies to a column when it is of type <strong>Date</strong>. The formatting of the date specified in tis field must be the same as in your CSV file. For example when your date format in the CSV file is DD/MM/YYYY and <strong>CSV Date format</strong> option is set to YYYY/DD/MM, you can encounter date bugs in your table.</p></li></ul></li><li>

It is a good idea to add condition to this rule to prevent exporting incomplete tables.</p></li><li>
<p>Under the <strong>Action</strong> section fill out the following:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Origin table</strong> - field that allows you to select the table you want to target when exporting into a CSV file. When selecting a table, new options appear:</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Columns to export</strong> - this is a checklist allowing you to select or deselect columns from a table that you want to keep or dismiss from exporting into the CSV file. These fields will correspond to field names given in your table, see below image for an example.</p><p><em>Table with three columns will correspond to <strong>Columns to export</strong> option in the export CSV edit rule dialog box.</em></p><p><img src=/images/export-csv-columns.jpg alt="Export to export checklist"></p></li><li>
<p><strong>CSV separator</strong> - the default separator is a comma <code> ,</code> but you can set it to any character, number or symbol you want. Keep in mind that the separator fields separates each column of a row. For example you can have a file that looks as follows when setting this field with a semi-colon <code>;</code>as shown with Notepad below:</p><p><img src=/images/export-csv-semicolon.jpg alt="Semicolon separated csv file"></p><p>Keep in mind when exporting a table using a separator other than a comma <code>,</code> and open it in Excel, the data will not be formatted correctly within Excel as it recognises columns when only separated by commas <code>,</code> for example the above file is opened with Notepad while the image below shows the same exported file opened with Excel:</p><p><img src=/images/export-csv-semicolon-excel.jpg alt="Semicolon separated csv file"></p></li><li>
<p><strong>Include header row</strong> - radio button asking whether to include the header row meaning that the column title will be included or not.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Destination file field</strong> - field specifying the container which hold the csv file of the exported table. When the CSV file is present in the file field, the name of the file will be the same as the title of the table specified to export. For example if the title of a table is <strong>Countries</strong>, the file will be called <strong>Countrie.csv</strong>. You can download the file by clicking on the file name.</p></li></ul></li><li>

Date rules can be utilised to set the time of a scheduled task, determine which process user submitted an instance first, and format dates that are inputted in date fields. To learn more about dates, see <a href=/platform/controls/input/date/>Date control</a>.</p><p>Below is an example of a date rule in operation; a <strong>Compare date</strong> rule is applied to a date field input in a form. If the date entered is after a set deadline, the field <strong>Status - After Deadline?</strong> in this process is set to Yes.

This can used in conjunction with the <a href=/platform/rules/workflow/schedule-a-rule/>Schedule a rule</a> rule to schedule reminders for certain process instances.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Calculate time</strong> - this rule calculates the number of time units between two dates, or between now/today and a given date.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Compare dates</strong> - this rule allows the comparison of date fields to know if one date is for example, between dates, before or after a given date. The rule could be used to ensure that process instances must be completed before an upcoming deadline.</p></li><li>

<h1 id=pg-cc54713fabd96656fe9603e59b2b6ece>11 - SharePoint rules</h1><p><strong>SharePoint</strong> rules is a category of rules within Kianda that are associated with SharePoint specific functionality. These rules are using SharePoint Application Programming Interface (<strong>API</strong>) to perform Create, Read, Update and Delete (<strong>CRUD</strong>) operations within your SharePoint connector. The SharePoint rules are designed to <strong>manage</strong> your SharePoint connector instead of populating it with data. With these rules you can create a site, a list or a group on your SharePoint connector along with adding users to groups, removing them from groups or changing user or group permissions.</p><p>Take an example of a <strong>Find a user</strong> rule. Implementing this rule will result in acquiring a <strong>Username</strong> or <strong>User Id</strong> of a particular user which is part of your SharePoint users group. When using SharePoint rules that are managing users, the <strong>Find a user</strong> rule is very useful as rules such as <strong>Add user to a group</strong> or <strong>remove user from a group</strong> require a <strong>User Id</strong> that can be retrieved from the <strong>Find a user</strong> rule.</p><h2 id=before-getting-started>Before getting started</h2><p>In advance of using the SharePoint rules you must have created a SharePoint data connector and establish a connection with your SharePoint site. The data connector is used as part of the SharePoint rules to perform CRUD operations on a site you established a connection with. To learn more about the SharePoint data connector go to <a href=/platform/connectors/sharepoint/>SharePoint connector</a>.</p><h2 id=getting-started-with-sharepoint-rules>Getting started with SharePoint rules</h2><p>If you go to <strong>Administration</strong> > <strong>Designer</strong> and click on a process or create a new process, then click on <strong>Add a rule</strong>, the <strong>SharePoint</strong> rules are found in the left-hand pane when you click on <strong>SharePoint</strong>.</p><p><img src=/images/sharepoint-rules-all.jpg alt="Sharepoint rules"></p><p>There are 10 <strong>SharePoint</strong> rules as follows:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Create a list</strong> - creates a new list in a SharePoint site.</li><li><strong>Create a site</strong> - creates a new site on SharePoint, enabling the use of a site template.</li><li><strong>Create a group</strong> - creates a new group on SharePoint</li><li><strong>Find a user</strong> - finds or searches for a user within SharePoint</li><li><strong>Add a user to a group</strong> - adds a SharePoint user to a SharePoint group. It is important to note the difference between SharePoint users and Kianda users. SharePoint users are users of the SharePoint system. Kianda users are users of the Kianda system.</li><li><strong>Remove a user from a group</strong> - removes a SharePoint user from a SharePoint group</li><li><strong>Reset an item permission</strong>s - changes the SharePoint permissions for a given list, document or folder.</li><li><strong>Check in / out an item</strong> - checks in or out a file in SharePoint</li><li><strong>Get attachments</strong> - reads the attachments from a SharePoint list</li><li><strong>Create anonymous link</strong> - creates anonymous links for a SharePoint held file</li></ul><h3 id=whats-next--idea-iconimages18png>What&rsquo;s next <img src=/images/18.png alt="Idea icon"></h3><p>We have briefly introduced each of the ten types of <strong>SharePoint rules</strong>.
