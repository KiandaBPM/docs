<h2 id=what-is-kianda>What is Kianda?</h2><p>Kianda is the most flexible low-code platform that you can use to create digital business processes. Kianda can be used in two ways:</p><ul>
<li>As a <strong>Designer or Administrator</strong> you can use the platform to <strong>design digital applications</strong> to drive your business. Prototypes can be built quickly and easily without the need for coding experience using Kianda <strong>Designer</strong> to create processes and forms to look and work the way you want. Choose from 16 predefined field types and 60 rules to create your forms within your processes. And if you don&rsquo;t like those and have some coding experience, use the no-code part of the platform Kianda <strong>Developer</strong> to create customised field, rule and dashboard widgets.</li><li>As a <strong>platform user</strong>, use the platform to <strong>input data</strong>, or gather and <strong>use data from external data sources</strong> like SharePoint or SAP, and then <strong>monitor process execution in a dashboard</strong> using seven widget types, from lists to chart, to get an at-a-glance overview of efficiencies or bottlenecks in your organisation. Forms and processes can also be shared with partner organisations or sent as anonymous links for third parties to complete.</li></ul><h2 id=how-does-kianda-work>How does Kianda work?</h2><p>The Kianda platform low-code platform is created with flexibility in mind, allowing simple user interactions to build complex processes.</p><p>Kianda has been constructed using an <strong>Model, View, Controller (MVC) approach</strong> (Model, View, Controller). This approach allows designers to build mobile-responsive applications via <strong>rapid User Interface (UI) prototyping</strong>. The UI provides an easy way to build an application by clicking, scrolling, and drag and drop of fields. The layout both provides a way to both build the application or process schema, and to capture and monitor data at run-time.</p><h3 id=whats-under-the-hood>What&rsquo;s under the &lsquo;hood&rsquo;?</h3><p><img src=/images/carhood.png alt="Man peering under the hood or bonnet of a car"></p><p>The MVC approach enables user or system-supplied data captured through fields within forms, to react or trigger defined rules associated with fields, forms or processes, via the <strong>rules engine</strong>.</p><h3 id=the-kianda-rules-engine>The Kianda <strong>rules-engine</strong></h3><p>The Kianda rules engine consists of:</p><ol>
<li>Rule blocks - these are blocks that unlock specific functionality using a toolkit approach</li><li>Flexible and declarative conditional logic</li></ol><p>These two components (rule blocks and conditional logic) are used extensively and recursively by designers to build the required orchestration of actions or rules that interact with data to provide the required functionality for your apps or processes.</p><p>The rules engine, combined with conditional logic enables designers to build ambitious, progressive web applications or end-to-end digital business processes that offer both a great UI and high performance.</p><p>In addition to the rules engine, CSS3, HTML5, EmberJS, WebApi and NodeJS are some of the underlying technologies used within the platform.</p><div class="alert alert-primary" role=alert>

<h1 id=pg-c945872435ed337e0554112e445d5b25>1 - Administration</h1><div class=lead>Details the administration menu options</div><p>The <strong>Administration</strong> menu contains all the functions you need to maintain your workspace.</p><p>The menu is found on the top right toolbar under the cog icon. This menu will only appear if you have an administrative role, for example <strong>Administrators</strong> will see all items.</p><p>Other roles like <strong>Developer</strong>, <strong>Design business process</strong>, <strong>Manage portals</strong>, <strong>Manage Datasources</strong> will have access to the Administration menu, but will only see role-related items within the menu. For example a Developer will only see <strong>Developer</strong> within Administration, while a person with a Design business process role will only see <strong>Designer</strong> within Administration. User roles are set by Administrator who will have access to the <strong>Users</strong> function within administration, see <a href=/platform/users-groups/>Users and Groups</a> for more information.</p><p>If you have full administration access then you will see nine functions by default within administration. These are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Designer</strong> - users with the Designer business process role and administrators can access this function to design business processes. Designer is the main feature that allows you to design process apps using the form designer.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Settings</strong> - administrators can update an organisation&rsquo;s subscription details, including Single Sign On, workspace look and feel, mobile app login design, storage files and regional settings.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Data sources</strong> - users with the <strong>Manage data sources</strong> role and administrators can access this function to manage centrally data sources in the workspace. These connectors can be used to retrieve data for processes and processes can automate the update and manipulation at the data source location.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Scheduled tasks</strong> - administrators can access this function to schedule tasks which can be full processes or parts of a process, for example to execute a rule, and schedule these tasks for a desired period or on demand. Within this function you can also view all existing scheduled tasks that could be rules executing within a process such as scheduled reminders.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Recycle bin</strong> - administrators can access deleted processes, tasks and process instances in the recycle bin and restore them to their original location.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Users & Groups</strong> - administrators can manage user accounts using this function for example setting roles, profile properties, creating and deleting groups.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Portals</strong> - Users with the Manage partners role and administrators can access this function to invite business partners to view processes.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Developer</strong> - Developers and administrators can access this function to create customised field, rule and dashboard widgets.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Support</strong> - This provides a shortcut to the application logs and access to system support functions.</p></li></ul></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always>
<h1 id=pg-33f3423d258a8d8063bd29130f18b006>2 - Process Designer</h1><div class=lead>Introduction to process designer</div><p>The process <strong>designer</strong> provides an intuitive interface where you can quickly start building a process app together with forms, fields and rules for any business use case. Forms are an important component of any process. They might be used as a stage of a process and can be made active individually or at the same time (parallel forms).</p><p>A <strong>process design</strong> is a JSON document that encapsulate the visual layout and logic that renders into a fully functional process app and allows users to perform all sort of tasks. The process designer allows process designers to easily compose the process JSON schema without ever requiring the user to write a single line of code.</p><h2 id=designer-introduction>Designer introduction</h2><p>This video introduces the process designer and demonstrates how to start creating a form and add fields to a process.</p><video width=100% style=width:100% controls>

<h2 id=preview-a-process>Preview a process</h2><p>As an <strong>Administrator</strong> or someone with the role <strong>Design business process</strong>, you can preview your <strong>process designs</strong> at any time using the <strong>Run and preview process</strong> button <img src=/images/previewer-btn.png alt="previewer button" style=zoom:75%>. This is a useful feature that allows you to preview your process, and visualise the logical flow of your design without publishing it yet for your users to view/use. Within the preview window, you can also troubleshoot your fields, rules and conditions by utilising the rule debugger feature.</p><img src=/images/preview-window.png alt="Preview window" style=zoom:50%>
<h3 id=how-to-launch-the-process-preview>How to launch the process preview</h3><ol>
<li>
<p>Navigate to the left-hand pane of the designer screen and click on the <strong>Run and preview process</strong> button <img src=/images/preview.png alt="run and preview process button" style=zoom:150%>. From here, your process will display in a preview window only to you or to other Process/workspace security users that have access to the design.</p></li><li>
<p>Within the process preview window, you can interact with controls and enter information as expected and the rules will execute on fields/buttons - the window displaying as a process instance, similar to when it will when published.</p></li><li>
<p>You can utilise the Rule debugger feature for troubleshooting purposes by clicking on the <strong>Enable / Disable Rule debugging</strong> button <img src=/images/rule-debugger-btn.png alt="rule debugger button" style=zoom:80%> in the top right corner of the window.</p></li><li>
<p>You can preview the process design from the perspective of different devices by clicking on the <strong>Device preview</strong> buttons to the right of the <strong>Rule debugger</strong> button. This feature will visualise how your process design is dynamic and responsive on a myriad of devices.
The options for device emulation are as follows:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Desktop preview</strong> <img src=/images/desktop-preview-btn.png alt="desktop preview button" style=zoom:80%> - displays the process instance as it would look on a desktop device.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Tablet preview</strong> <img src=/images/tablet-preview-btn.png alt="Tablet preview button"> - displays the process instance as it would look on a tablet device.</p><img src=/images/tablet-preview-screen.png alt="tablet preview screen" style=zoom:50%>
</li><li>
<p><strong>Mobile preview</strong> <img src=/images/mobile-preview-btn.png alt="Mobile preview button"> - displays the process instance as it would look on a mobile device.</p><img src=/images/mobile-preview-screen.png alt="Mobile preview screen" style=zoom:50%>
</li></ul><p><strong>Note</strong>: If you select <strong>Tablet preview</strong> or <strong>Mobile preview</strong>, a <strong>Rotate device</strong> button <img src=/images/rotate-btn.png alt="rotate device button"> will appear in the top right-hand corner. Clicking on this button will rotate the device screen from portrait to landscape and vice versa in the preview window.</p><p><img src=/images/rotated-phone.png alt="Rotate screen"></p></li><li>
<p>When you are finished previewing your process design, click on the <strong>Exit preview mode</strong> button <img src=/images/exit-preview-window-btn.png alt="Exit preview mode button"> in the top right-hand corner of the previewer window.</p></li></ol><h2 id=add-new-forms>Add new forms</h2><p>Add new forms by clicking the <strong>add form</strong> button on the top of the designer screen. Options will be displayed to allow you to configure how the form should work.</p><h2 id=editing-forms>Editing forms</h2><p>Click on the form tab on top of the designer to reveal the form edit button (pencil) clicking this button will open the form editor and reveal its properties.</p><h2 id=import-forms>Import forms</h2><p>Within the process designer you can import forms and other fields from other process designs within your workspace.

The <strong>Version number</strong> of a process will be updated every time a process design is saved by clicking on <strong>Save button</strong>.</p><p>The designer maintans two types of versions: Draft and published. Draft versions are only visible to administrators and designers while the last published version is visible to end users.</p><p>A design without a published version cannot be used by an end-user to create a new record.</p><p>The <strong>current or active version</strong> of a process is always visible in the right-hand pane, for example V0.34.</p><p>The <strong>first version</strong> of a process is <strong>0.1</strong> and will increment to 0.2 and so on, each time a process is saved. Once the process is <strong>published</strong> the version changes to <strong>1.0</strong> and increments with each publication.</p><p>If the process is subsequently <strong>saved</strong>, then the next version will be <strong>V1.1</strong> and the next <strong>published version</strong> will be <strong>V2.0</strong>.</p><p>Using versioning makes it is easy to keep track of changes and to restore the design to an older version if needed.</p><h2 id=process-settings>Process Settings</h2><p>You can use <strong>Settings</strong> to control process wide settings for the current process design and control things like behavious of form tabs, process security and anonymous access of the process.</p><h3 id=general-settings>General settings</h3><p><strong>Process ID Settings</strong>: Use this to control how the process record ID generation. The default record ID is a combination of the process ID and the record ID,example: process-1.</p><p>With this setting designers can use any combination of fields or expression to generate the record unique ID.</p><p><strong>Onload rules execution mode</strong>: Controls when onload rules execute.

Users without access to the record receive access denied error.</p><p>The following are the available security modes:</p><ol>
<li><strong>Restricted creator</strong>: With this security mode only indicated users can create a new record of the process, users assigned to the record can update it and everyone else can only view it.</li><li><strong>Restricted assign to</strong>: With this security mode only indicated users can create a new record, assign to users can view or modify it, everyone else cannot view the record.</li><li><strong>Restricted</strong>: This is the most restricted security mode. Only directly indicated users can create, view or update records.</li></ol><h3 id=tabs>Tabs</h3><p>Use the tabs to configure how the process tabs will behave including its look & feel. Control here setttings such hidding the form tabs altogether, hidding the workspace left nav and enabling the mobile footer navbar.</p><p>You can also configure here the colours for the selected tab and trhe completed (submited) tab.</p><h3 id=anonymous-form>Anonymous form</h3><p>Use the anonymous form tab to enable at process level anonymous form submission.</p><p>When enabled the user has the option to create the <strong>new record anonymous link</strong>. This is a unique link that allows users to submit new records without authentication.</p><h2 id=process-instances>Process instances</h2><p>When your process is created in Designer, you can save the process, and then <strong>submit data</strong> to that process. When you save or submit data, then an <strong>instance</strong> of the process is created. Another name for a process instance is a <strong>record</strong>. This instance is tied to user data or calculated values, or to whatever the process is designed to do.</p><p>The instance has a unique ID which can be seen in a list widget in a <strong>dashboard</strong>. For example, this List widget displays the individual records of various training requests submitted by employees. The unique ID for each record is shown in the first column. Form owners or those with security access can click on ID ‘training-request-and-feedback-process-26’ to view the training request form completed and submitted by employee Mark Donnelli.</p><p><em><strong>List widget in a dashboard showing process instances</strong></em></p><p><img src=/images/process-instance.jpg alt="Process instance example"></p><p>This means that each new record generated by a process will have its own unique URL that can be shared with those who have the required security access and need to be involved in that <strong>particular process instance</strong>. For example, in this case, the training request submitted by Mark (an employee) may be viewed and approved by his line manager:</p><p>You can create a link on your dashboard – in the example shown above, the <strong>Start new process</strong> button at the top right of the Training Requests list widget – that enables you to create a <strong>new record</strong> by bringing you into the relevant form. For information on creating list widgets go to <a href=/platform/pages/list/>List widget</a>.</p><p>If you commit to the process by <strong>submitting or saving information</strong>, then the result is a new process instance – that is, a new unique record – which will be seen in a list widget in the dashboard, as seen in the image above.</p><p>Keeping in mind that Designer is used to create processes, and that each ‘run’ of the process design results in a unique process instance or record, will help you later on when designing forms and dashboards.</p><h3 id=instance-common-fields>Instance Common fields</h3><p>The non-design fields associated with all Kianda processes are listed below. It is useful to keep these fields in mind when designing forms, as they can be used to retrieve, store or display values from <strong>process instances</strong> for example <strong>Status</strong> which is the status of a process instance. Using these &lsquo;internal values&rsquo; could be useful where the status of one process could be used as a condition to trigger the start of another process, for example using the <a href=/platform/rules/workflow/start-a-process/><strong>Start a process</strong></a> rule.</p><p>The common fields associated with process instances are:</p><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Field name</th><th>Explanation</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>ID</strong></td><td>This is the <strong>process instance ID</strong>, labelled as &lsquo;process-name-number&rsquo;, for example &lsquo;safety-inspection-8&rsquo;. This ID is part of the URL that brings you to the process instance/record held on the system when information is either submitted or saved. For example clicking on the process instance ID &lsquo;safety-inspection-8&rsquo; in a dashboard brings you to the form.</td></tr><tr>
<td><strong>Unique ID</strong></td><td>This is a <strong>system generated ID</strong> for each process instance, a 32 letter and number generated value.</td></tr><tr>
<td><strong>Status</strong></td><td>This is the status for the process instance, that is either a &lsquo;<strong>form name</strong>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<strong>Completed</strong>&rsquo;. Completed indicates that all forms in a process have been submitted, while &lsquo;form name&rsquo; indicates what the active form is in the process, that is, where the process is &lsquo;at&rsquo;. For example in a process of two forms, a Request form and an Approval form. Once the Request form has been submitted then the status for a process is &lsquo;Approval form&rsquo; indicating that this form needs to be completed.</td></tr><tr>
<td><strong>Version</strong></td><td>This is the <strong>process instance version number</strong> that starts as 1.0. If a process instance is updated, for example if a process design is updated and published and process instances are updated with the change, then the next version of the instance will be 2.0.</td></tr><tr>
<td><strong>Process Version</strong></td><td>This is the <strong>process design version</strong>, that is the version of the process design that has been used as a template for the process instance.</td></tr><tr>
<td><strong>Process Name</strong></td><td>This is the <strong>Unique ID name</strong> that comes from the process design that is the template for the process instance. The ID is created when the process is created. The ID field autofills from the title of the process as shown in <a href=/platform/application-designer/#creating-your-first-process>Create your first process</a>.</td></tr><tr>
<td><strong>Process Title</strong></td><td>This is the <strong>Process title</strong> that comes from the process design title, created when the process is created or updated, for example see <a href=/platform/application-designer/#creating-your-first-process>Create your first process</a>.</td></tr><tr>
<td><strong>Created</strong></td><td>This is a <strong>date and time stamp</strong> when the process instance is created.</td></tr><tr>
<td><strong>Created by</strong></td><td>This is the <strong>user name</strong> of the user who <strong>created</strong> the process instance.</td></tr><tr>
<td><strong>Modified</strong></td><td>This is the <strong>date and time stamp</strong> when the process instance is modified, for example after a process design is published and existing process instances are updated.</td></tr><tr>
<td><strong>Modified by</strong></td><td>This is the <strong>user name</strong> of the user who <strong>modified</strong> the process instance.</td></tr><tr>
<td><strong>Assign to</strong></td><td>This is the <strong>user name</strong> of the user who a process is <strong>assigned</strong> to. Process designs may have a static option for reassignment in their design so that process instances can be reassigned using <a href=/platform/application-designer/forms/form-quick-action/#how-to-get-started>Quick actions</a>. Alternatively the <a href=/platform/rules/workflow/assign-form/>Assign form</a> rule can be used to dynamically assign form ownership to another user. That user is named in the <strong>Assign to</strong> field.</td></tr><tr>
<td><strong>Security users</strong></td><td>These are the named security users, defined using <a href=/platform/application-designer/process/settings/#process-settings><strong>Process settings</strong></a> by selecting <strong>Enable process security</strong> and naming <strong>Process security users</strong> which can be <strong>Users</strong>, <strong>Groups</strong> and/or <strong>Partners</strong>.</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always>
<h1 id=pg-4b853c10dfa95e7e05ac9bb1859137c8>2.1 - Forms</h1><h2 id=introduction>Introduction</h2><p>Processes in Kianda are made up of <strong>forms</strong>. Forms contain all the buttons, fields, and rule triggers needed to execute your process.</p><p>You can use the <strong>Designer</strong> to design <strong>forms</strong> for <strong>end users</strong> who will use the platform to submit, save and review information, either as named users in the platform, users who receive a link to an anonymous form, or partners who can access shared processes. These end users will create new <strong>process instances</strong> or records in the system, or access <strong>existing process instances</strong> which shows information that has either been <strong>saved or submitted</strong> in a form.</p><p>When discussing forms we&rsquo;ll talk about <strong>form design</strong> that is creating and updating forms within a process using Kianda <strong>Designer</strong> as well <strong>form use</strong> which refers to end users who will edit or read forms in a process instance/record in the system, built using the <strong>Designer</strong>.</p><h2 id=form-design-principles>Form design principles</h2><p>As you work with Kianda <strong>Designer</strong> you are designing the &lsquo;user interface&rsquo; for users to interact with a particular process. Keeping the end user in mind, there are three design principles:</p><ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Reading modes</strong>: <strong>Form users</strong> can either use/access forms in <strong>edit</strong> mode or <strong>read</strong> mode. Edit mode means that users can submit information, while read mode means that users can only view forms. The latter may be useful for example for certain staff to review customer feedback in a form, but not be able to change/edit the feedback form.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Current form</strong>: Typically there are several forms in a process, and by default the <strong>first form</strong> in a process is the <strong>current form</strong>.</p><p><img src=/images/3-form-example.jpg alt="Three form process example"></p><p>For example in the Training Attendance Process above, the process flow is as follows:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Training Request</strong> - an employee initiates a process instance by filling out this form</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Training Approval</strong> - the manager approves the request using this form</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Training Attendance</strong> - when training approval occurs, a trainer invites the employee to attend training and once complete, the trainer completes a this form to evaluate the employee&rsquo;s participation.</p><p>Therefore when a process instance is initiated upon submission of the <strong>Training Request</strong> form, then the next form in the process becomes the <strong>current form</strong>, in this case the <strong>Training Approval</strong> form.</p><p>Only the form that has the status ‘<strong>current form’</strong> <strong>is editable</strong> by a form owner (see point 3 below). In a complex multi-step process, several forms can be configured to <strong>activate with</strong> the current form, meaning they are also editable at the same time, creating a <strong>form group</strong>, see section 2 of <a href=#new-form-creation>New form creation</a>. Rules can also be used to change the workflow and make other forms the &lsquo;current form&rsquo;.</p><p>Also note that <strong>all first forms</strong> in a process flow add the current user as a &lsquo;form owner&rsquo; therefore allowing <strong>all users</strong> to edit the first form, as clicking on &lsquo;submit&rsquo; or &lsquo;save&rsquo; in the first form results in a new process instance.</p></li></ul></li><li>
<p><strong>Form owner</strong>: The <strong>default owner</strong> is the person or group that the form is assigned to, this means they can <strong>edit the <u>current</u> form(s) in a process instance</strong>. Default owners are typically set when a form is created, see section 1 of <a href=#new-form-creation>New form creation</a> below. By default, <strong>only this person or group can edit the <u>current</u> form</strong> in a process instance. All other users can only view forms in read mode. The default owner however can reassign forms to other individuals and/or groups. Form ownership can also be assigned dynamically using the <a href=/platform/rules/workflow/assign-form/>Assign form</a> rule.</p></li></ol><p>These three considerations are established when the form is created, as seen in the dialog box below, and these parameters can be updated at any time by editing the form design. These properties can also change <strong>dynamically</strong> as a result of <strong>implementing rules</strong>, for example the <a href=/platform/rules/workflow/go-to-form/>Go to form</a> rule can change the workflow in a process.</p><h3 id=new-form-creation>New form creation</h3><p>As mentioned above there are certain considerations to keep in mind when working with forms. The image below shows a <strong>New form</strong> dialog box that is created when the <strong>Add form</strong> button is clicked in Kianda Designer. At any time if you click on a form and then the <strong>Edit/pen</strong> button <img src=/images/penicon.png alt="Edit/pen button"> an <strong>Edit form</strong> dialog box appears which has the same parameters as the one shown in the image below.</p><p><em><strong>New form dialog box</strong></em></p><p><img src=https://academy.kianda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/newformsegments-1.gif alt=img></p><h5 id=new-form-considerations>New form considerations</h5><ol>
<li>The <strong>Default owner(s)</strong> field is where you can set individuals and groups as the default <strong>form owners</strong> who can edit the form.</li><li><strong>Activate with</strong> means that the form can be activated with other forms within the process, so they can be edited at the same time. This means several forms become the <strong>current form</strong> in a form group.</li><li><strong>Submit mode</strong> means that when a process instance is running you can choose <strong>only this form</strong> to be submitted, or you can choose <strong>all forms in edit mode</strong> meaning that several forms could have their details submitted or saved.</li><li><strong>Enable quick actions</strong> allows you to <strong>statically</strong> enable a) reassignment, b) edit, and c) custom actions on any form. For a) and b) you can choose individuals and/or groups who can reassign or edit forms. In the case of b) edit there are options to <strong>hide form footer buttons</strong> when editing, and to <strong>trigger rules on save</strong> against a set field when saving edits. For c) custom actions, you can set your own custom action and create an action label against a particular form field. This means that the user(s) assigning the custom action will see the labelled action designated for them. As a designer you can choose the <strong>action display mode</strong> as read-only, edit or both, so you can decide what type of access the user(s) will have.</li></ol><h2 id=related-rules>Related rules</h2><p>The following are rules that are directly associated with working with forms and form state.</p><ol>
<li><strong>Go to form</strong>: This rule enables the designer to provide a way for users navigate to any form within the process.</li><li><strong>Assign form</strong>: This rule allows designers to dynamically change the default form owners of forms from user picker fields or other means.</li><li><strong>Submit form</strong>: This rule marks the form as complete or submited and allows the process to progress the workflow to the next available form.</li><li><strong>Field display mode</strong>: This rule forces the form display mode to be editable or read only even when the current user is not a form owner.</li></ol></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always>
<h1 id=pg-4d38f94b362ed301e62446b48ac0457a>2.1.1 - Form owners</h1><p>When creating forms, it is important to consider <strong>form access</strong> during the design phase, that is who can access and edit forms <strong>in a process instance</strong>. For example if an employee submits a performance review form, a line manager may wish to access that submitted process instance/record and edit the form, adding in comments and performance grades.</p><p>There are two key principles to keep in mind in terms of <strong>form access</strong>:</p><ol>
<li>
<p>Forms are <strong>assignable</strong> - this means that forms can be assigned to individuals and/or groups, and then only they can <strong>edit</strong> the form, when it is the current form, in a process instance. The &lsquo;assignee&rsquo; can be a combination of users and groups. There are various ways a form can be assigned to a user:</p><p>​ a) Using <strong>Rules</strong>, in particular the Workflow rule <strong>Assign form</strong>, see <a href=/platform/rules/workflow/assign-form/>Assign form</a> for details</p><p>​ b) Using <strong>Quick actions</strong>, see <a href=/platform/application-designer/forms/form-quick-action/>Form Quick action</a> for details</p><p>​ c) Creating <strong>form owners</strong> when creating or updating a process design, see <a href=#creating-form-owners>Creating form owners</a> for details</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Only form owners</strong> can edit a given form when it is a <strong>current form</strong> in a process flow by <strong>default</strong>. Any other user with access to view the form will see it in read-only mode.</p></li></ol><p>So what is <strong>form owner</strong>? A form owner is assigned when a form is created in Kianda <strong>Designer</strong>. Form owners can also be added to a form design at a later stage by editing the form. Only the form owner will be able to <strong>edit current forms</strong> in <strong>process instances</strong> (records), see below.</p><h2 id=changing-form-access>Changing form access</h2><p>The <strong>default owner</strong> is the person or group that the form is assigned to using the <strong>default owner field</strong> in the <strong>new form</strong> dialog box as shown above. By default, only this person or group <strong>can edit the current form</strong> in a process instance. All other users can only view forms in read mode. The next section details how to <a href=#changing-default-owners>Change default owners</a>.</p><p>It is also possible to allow other users to have edit access to forms using the <a href=/platform/rules/workflow/assign-form/>Assign rule</a> and <a href=/platform/application-designer/forms/form-quick-action/>Quick actions</a>.</p><h3 id=changing-default-owners>Changing default owners</h3><ol>
<li>
<p>Using your <strong>Administration</strong> or <strong>Design business process</strong> role, go to <strong>Administration</strong> > <strong>Designer</strong> > select a process > select a form in the process.</p></li><li>
<p>Click on the form so the <strong>Edit/Pen</strong> button appears in the form name.</p><p><img src=/images/select-form-to-edit.jpg alt="Select form to edit"></p></li><li>
<p>Then click on the <strong>Edit/Pen</strong> button itself to edit the form.</p></li><li>
<p>An <strong>Edit form</strong> dialog box opens which has the same layout as the <strong>New form</strong> dialog box seen in <a href=#creating-form-owners>Creating form owners</a> above.</p><p><img src=/images/edit-form-dialog-box.jpg alt="Edit form dialog box"></p></li><li>
<p>Here you can change the default owner choosing from <strong>Users</strong>, <strong>Groups</strong> as before.</p></li></ol></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always>
<h1 id=pg-88ff85030afe7df99a1c39216553b8cd>2.1.2 - Form display modes</h1><p>Remember there are three principles to consider when working with forms:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Display mode</strong>: <strong>Form users</strong> can either use forms in <strong>edit</strong> mode or <strong>read</strong> mode. Edit mode means that users can submit information, while read mode means that users can only view forms. The latter may be useful for example for certain staff to review feedback in a form, but not be able to edit/update it.</li><li><strong>Form owner</strong>: The <strong>default owner</strong> is the person or group that the form is assigned to <strong>when the the form is created</strong>. By default, only this person or group <strong>can edit the current form</strong>. All other users can only view forms in read mode. The default owner however can reassign forms to other individuals and/or groups.</li><li><strong>Current form</strong>: Typically there are several forms in a process, and only the form that has the status ‘<strong>current form’</strong> is <strong>editable</strong>. However, in a complex multi-step process, other forms can be configured to <strong>activate with</strong> the current form, meaning they can also become editable at the same time, creating a form group.</li></ul><p>These three considerations are established when the form is created, as seen in the dialog box below.</p><p><em><strong>New form dialog box</strong></em></p><p><img src=/images/newformsegments-1.gif alt="New form dialog box"></p><p>These properties can also change <strong>dynamically</strong> as a result of <strong>rules being applied</strong>, see <a href=/platform/rules/>Rules</a>.</p><h3 id=setting-display-modes-statically>Setting display modes statically</h3><p>Remember forms in process instances are either in <strong>edit mode</strong> meaning they can be edited/changed or <strong>read mode</strong> where the details are visible to form users but cannot be changed. The actions below refer to making forms <strong>editable</strong> so if the actions below are not used, then the forms are in <strong>read mode</strong>. The actions below refer to static or fixed use, set when the form is first created or updated at a later time.</p><ol>
<li>
<p>Forms in process instances will be <strong>editable</strong> for <strong>Default owner(s)</strong>, that is the <strong>form owners</strong> defined when the form is created, or a form is edited. Form owners are defined in the <strong>New form/Edit form</strong> dialog box, shown in part 1 of the image above. When a process instance runs, the form owner can then edit the form in that instance.</p></li><li>
<p>By default the <strong>first form</strong> in a process becomes the <strong>current form</strong>, so only this form will be <strong>editable</strong>. However if several forms are <strong>activated with</strong> the current form when the form is created or edited in the <strong>New form/Edit form</strong> dialog box shown above, then <strong>all forms in that group</strong> will be editable by the form owner in a process instance.</p></li><li>
<p>By default the <strong>Submit mode</strong> for forms is <strong>Only this form</strong> meaning that when a process instance is running you can choose <u>only</u> that particular form can have details submitted or saved. Alternatively you can choose <strong>all forms in edit mode</strong>, meaning that several forms can have their details submitted or saved. For example if several forms are activated together and all are in <strong>edit mode</strong> then the details of all these forms can be submitted together in the database.</p></li><li>
<p>Forms can be statically set to allow <strong>Quick actions</strong> including allowing <strong>editing</strong>. When a form is created or edited using the <strong>New form/Edit form</strong> dialog box, clicking on <strong>Enable quick actions</strong> allows you to <strong>statically</strong> enable:</p><p>a) <strong>reassignment</strong> of forms</p><p>b) <strong>editing</strong> of forms</p><p>c) <strong>custom actions</strong> on any form</p><p>For a) and b) you can choose individuals and/or groups who can reassign or edit forms. In the case of b) edit there are options to <strong>hide form footer buttons</strong> when editing, and to <strong>trigger rules on save</strong> against a set field when saving edits.</p><p><img src=/images/enable-edit-action.jpg alt="Enable edit action"></p><p>For c) custom actions, you can set your own custom action and create an action label against a particular form field. This means that the user(s) assigning the custom action will see the labelled action designated for them. As a designer you can choose the <strong>action display mode</strong> as read-only, edit or both, so you can decide what type of access the user(s) will have.</p></li></ol><h3 id=changing-form-display-dynamically-with-rules>Changing form display dynamically with rules</h3><p>If you use the <strong>Form action</strong> rule called <strong>Field display mode</strong>, you can change how a field or form displays <strong>dynamically</strong>. For example you have a condition set that the display will change based on the condition being present or not.</p><p>When you add this rule, under <strong>Action</strong> you can choose a field or form and choose from <strong>Edit mode</strong> or <strong>Read mode</strong>.</p><p><img src=/images/field-display-rule.jpg alt="Field display rule"></p><p>For more information on this rule go to <a href=/platform/rules/form-actions/field-display-mode/>Field Display mode rule</a>.</p><p>Other rules can be used in other ways to change process workflow and therefore how forms behave. For example using the <a href=/platform/rules/workflow/assign-form/>Assign form rule</a> you can assign a form to a particular user, making them the form owner, and therefore giving them edit access to the form.</p><h3 id=whats-next--idea-iconimages18png>What&rsquo;s next <img src=/images/18.png alt="Idea icon"></h3><p>To read more about form ownership go to <a href=/platform/application-designer/forms/form-owners/>Form owner</a>.

<h1 id=pg-349cd881499431aa635281086e2608af>2.2 - Components</h1><p>A process <strong>component</strong> acts like a reusable part of a <strong>process</strong> made up of <strong>various</strong> control <strong>fields and rules</strong>. You can <strong>reuse</strong> the component in your process designs to save you time and effort when creating each field and rule combination from the beginning. Within the component you can add all preconfigured control types and rules to match your needs, as well as customised field and rules found under <strong>Custom</strong>.</p><p>Creating a component will <strong>significantly</strong> <strong>speed up</strong> your process <strong>creation time</strong> if some of your processes demand the <strong>same fields and logic</strong>. For example if a lot of your processes have sections in common, for example a <strong>Personal Details</strong> section where a user needs to fill in their <strong>first</strong> and <strong>last</strong> <strong>name</strong>, <strong>email</strong>, <strong>job role</strong>, and <strong>phone</strong> <strong>number</strong>. To save process creation time, you can create a component with those exact fields and rules you need and then use the component in various process designs.</p><p>The component you create can be updated at any time. Once you publish your component it can be used in any process of your choice and any processes that already use your component will be automatically updated.</p><h3 id=how-to-create-a-new-component>How to create a new component</h3><ol>

<p><strong>Always set date even if not empty</strong> - if you select this option, this means that the default date you&rsquo;ve chosen to be automatically inserted when a user opens the form will be updated/changed <em>each time</em> the user goes into the form. In other words, the initial date that was inserted when the form was first opened will be replaced/updated when the user goes back into the form. If you want the date field to retain the initial date the user started to complete the form, do not tick this checkbox.</p></li><li>

<p>Select the form within that process that you want to add the field to (so that the <strong>Edit Form</strong> button <img src=/images/penicon.png alt="Edit form button"> is visible).</p></li><li>
<p>Click on <strong>Controls</strong> in the left-hand pane to expand the Controls menu.</p></li><li>
<p>Select <strong>Input</strong> to view the range of Input controls and click on <strong>File</strong>. A <strong>New field - File</strong> dialog box will open with a range of options you can choose from for your new File upload field.</p><p><img src=/images/new-file-field2.jpg alt="Edit file upload field dialog box"></p></li><li>
<p><strong>Title</strong>: You can change the name of the File upload field from the default &lsquo;<strong>File 1</strong>&rsquo;.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Name</strong> - This is a unique name for the field and inherits a camel case version of the entered Title.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Help text</strong>: You can insert text to help the form user to complete the File upload field - if you add help text, a question mark <img src=/images/help-icon.jpg alt="Help text icon"> icon will appear next to the field title and, if the user clicks on this, they will see the help text you have inserted.</p><p><img src=/images/file-upload-help-text.jpg alt="File upload help text example"></p></li><li>
<p><strong>Custom CSS class name</strong> - You can type the name of a CSS class to allow the File upload to inherit specific styles defined in the <a href=/low-code/global-css/>Global CSS file</a>.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Save location</strong>: This is the location the file will be saved to. When you click on the <strong>Destination</strong> button, a <strong>Select datasource</strong> dialog box opens in which you can choose where to save the file(s):</p><p><img src=/images/file-upload-datasource.jpg alt="Select datasource dialog box"></p><p>You can choose to save the file or files to Kianda or to another external data source.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Open file behaviour</strong>: You can choose whether the file is downloaded or opens in an internet browser.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Folder structure</strong>: If you have chosen an external data source as the &lsquo;Save location&rsquo; for the file(s) uploaded to the file upload field, you can then choose the folder structure you want to use for saving the files to that external data source.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Allow file override</strong>: You can choose whether or not to allow file override. If you choose &lsquo;Yes&rsquo;, if a user goes back into the form and uploads another file to the File upload field, this will override the original file they had uploaded. This option works in conjunction with the <strong>Allow uploading multiple files</strong> option - if you choose to allow multiple files to be uploaded, then the &lsquo;Allow file override&rsquo; option is no longer relevant (as uploading more files will not override file/files already uploaded).</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Allow remove file</strong>: If you select <strong>Yes</strong>, this allows the form user to come back into the form and remove the file they had previously uploaded, and another option appears - <strong>Remove and delete file</strong>: if you choose <strong>Yes</strong>, when the file is removed, it will also be deleted from the location where it was stored specified in the <strong>Save location</strong>; if you choose <strong>No</strong>, then only the reference to the file is removed from the form and the file remains in the <strong>Save location</strong>.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Allow uploading multiple files</strong>: Choose <strong>No</strong> to only allow the user to upload one file or choose <strong>Yes</strong> to allow the user to upload multiple files.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>File name options</strong>: Choose whether to keep the original file name, to have the file name auto generated by the system, or to be based on a form field. If you choose <strong>From form field</strong>, another option appears - <strong>File name field</strong> - allows you to select a field representing the name of the file:</p><p><img src=/images/file-name-field.jpg alt="File name field"></p></li><li>
<p><strong>File extension</strong>: You can set/limit the type of file(s) that can be uploaded by inserting a specific file type. For example, if you insert <strong>.pdf</strong> in the File extension box, when the user browses for the file to attach, the file type will automatically be set to .pdf. If you want to allow any type of file to be attached, leave this option blank.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Enable media capture</strong>: If you choose <strong>Yes</strong>, this enables the user to capture media to upload - on a mobile device, when the user clicks on the Upload button their camera/video recorder will open (depending on whether you&rsquo;ve selected the file extension to be image or video).</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Button text</strong>: By default, the File upload icon has the text <strong>Browse</strong>, but you can change this here.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Button icon</strong>: By default, the file upload icon is <img src=/images/file-upload-icon.jpg alt="File upload icon"> but you can change this by clicking the <strong>Button icon</strong> drop-down menu and choosing a different icon from the large range of icons available.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Enable background upload</strong>: Select this checkbox to enable files to be uploaded using a background operation. This option is typically used in conjunction with the <strong>Enable chunked upload</strong> option.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Enable chunked upload</strong>: Select this checkbox to upload files using resumable chunks. This option can be useful if the file size is likely to be large or the network speed is likely to be slow.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> If you select <strong>Enable background upload</strong> and <strong>Enable chunked upload</strong> there is an additional step you need to take to ensure that these upload options work. In your form, you need to select <u>each field or button</u> that has a <strong>Save process rule</strong> applied to it, click on that rule to open the <strong>Edit rule</strong> dialog box and select the <strong>Perform background save</strong> checkbox. Then click <strong>OK</strong>. This will ensure that the upload options you&rsquo;ve chosen for your File upload field work as intended.</p><p>For example, you would need to select the &lsquo;Save process&rsquo; rule attached to the &lsquo;Save&rsquo; button in your form (by clicking on the <strong>Save</strong> button and then clicking on the <strong>Save process</strong> rule):</p><p><img src=/images/selecting-save-process-rule.jpg alt="Selecting Save Process rule"></p><p>This opens the <strong>Edit rule - Save form</strong> dialog box - check the <strong>Perform background save</strong> option and then click <strong>OK</strong>:</p><p><img src=/images/save-process-rule-perform-background.jpg alt="Edit rule dialog box perform background save"></p><p>If the <strong>Enable background upload</strong> and <strong>Enable chunked upload</strong> options are chosen and a user completes a form while they are in an area with poor coverage, once the user re-establishes internet connection they will need to go back into Kianda and click the <strong>Force refresh</strong> button <img src=/images/refresh.png alt="Refresh button"> at the top right of the <strong>Home</strong> page.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Show uploaded files count</strong>: Select <strong>Yes</strong> to show the number of uploaded files.</li></ul></li><li>
<p>Once you complete the <strong>New field - File</strong> dialog box and click <strong>OK</strong>, a new <strong>File upload field</strong> is added to your form, with the name you inserted as the <strong>Title</strong> in the dialog box (by default the title is <strong>File 1</strong> unless you change it).</p></li></ol><p>In the example of our Inspection Form, the new File upload field (titled <strong>Upload photos</strong>) added to the form could look like this when a user views it on a mobile phone (to see how your form or field will look on a mobile, view it in <strong>Mobile preview</strong> by using the <strong>Preview</strong> option which can be opened by clicking the play button icon <img src=/images/preview.png alt=Preview>):</p><p><img src=/images/file-upload-example-mobile.jpg alt="File upload example mobile phone"></p><h3 id=how-to-edit-move-and-delete-file-upload-fields>How to edit, move and delete File upload fields</h3><p>To edit a <strong>File upload field</strong>:</p><ol>

There are different display options - from drop-down lists to checklists - as well as other options (like the ability to make a list field mandatory for a user to complete).</p><p>For example, you could insert a list field in your form that will show a drop-down list of Types of Training that is maintained on SharePoint. The <strong>advantage</strong> of linking to an external data source like this is that your list will stay <strong>up-to-date</strong> with any changes made to the list on SharePoint.</p><h2 id=how-to-get-started>How to get started</h2><ol>
<li>
<p>To add a <strong>List field</strong> to a form, first open the relevant process.</p></li><li>
<p>Select the form within that process that you want to add the field to (so that the <strong>Edit Form</strong> button <img src=/images/penicon.png alt="Edit form button"> is visible). If you want to add the List field to a panel within your form, first select the panel by clicking on it and then add the <strong>List field</strong>.</p></li><li>
<p>Click on <strong>Controls</strong> in the left-hand pane to expand the Controls menu.</p></li><li>

<li>
<p><strong>Title</strong> - You can change the name of the List field from the default title <strong>List 1</strong>. For example, if you are working on a Training Request form, you may want to insert a List field to contain the types of training and may choose to title this &lsquo;Type of Training&rsquo;.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Name</strong> - This is a unique name for the field and inherits a camel case version of the entered Title.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Help text</strong> - You can insert text to help the form user to complete the List field. If you add help text, a question mark <img src=/images/help-icon.jpg alt="Help text icon"> icon will appear next to the field title and, if the user clicks on this, they will see the help text you have inserted. In this example, the list field is titled &lsquo;Type of Training&rsquo; and has associated help text:</p><p><img src=/images/list-field-help-text.jpg alt="List field help text example"></p></li><li>
<p><strong>Custom CSS class name</strong> - You can type the name of a CSS class to allow the List to inherit specific styles defined in the <a href=/low-code/global-css/>Global CSS file</a>.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>List source</strong> - You have three main options in terms of the source of the choices that will appear in your List field:</p><p>a) <strong>Entered manually</strong></p><p>b) <strong>Form data</strong></p><p>c) <strong>Data source</strong></p><p>We will look at each of these three list source options in turn.</p><p>If you select the <strong>Entered manually</strong> checkbox, you must then manually type the choices you want to appear in your list into the <strong>List source</strong> box.

<p><strong>Display format</strong> - You can choose to have your list field appear as either a Drop-down list, a Radio list, Multi-select or a Checkbox list.</p><p>By default, the <strong>Dropdown list</strong> radio button is selected, along with two additional options - <strong>Filter mode</strong> (you can choose either &lsquo;Starts With&rsquo; or &lsquo;Contains&rsquo;) and <strong>Enable native selector on mobile</strong> (so a user completing the list field on their mobile phone can use the default list selector on it).</p><p><img src=/images/list-display-format.jpg alt="Dropdown list display format"></p><p>If you choose <strong>Radio list</strong> or <strong>Checkbox list</strong> you can choose a <strong>List display position</strong> of either Vertical or Horizontal.</p></li><li>

<p><strong>Expression</strong> - you can add an expression to your Number field if, for example, you want the field to contain a calculation based on another field or want it to pull values from other fields. To add an expression, click on the expression button (ellipsis) <img src=/images/ellipsis.png alt="Expression button ellipsis"> to open the <strong>Expression builder</strong> dialog box - here you can add expressions to perform math operations and various other actions.</p><p>For example, let&rsquo;s say you have a Number field called &lsquo;Salary&rsquo; where the user inputs their salary and another Number field called &lsquo;Bonus&rsquo; which you want to be automatically populated with a figure that is 20% of the &lsquo;Salary&rsquo; figure. To do this, you add an Expression to the &lsquo;Bonus&rsquo; field:</p><p><img src=/images/number-expression-example.jpg alt="Expression builder"></p><p>Now when a user completes the &lsquo;Salary&rsquo; field, the Bonus field automatically populates with a figure that is 20% of their salary:</p><p><img src=/images/number-expression-example2.jpg alt="Number expression example"></p><p>To learn more about applying rules and expressions to Number fields, go to <a href=/platform/rules/>Rules</a> and <a href=/platform/rules/general/expression-builder>Expression builder</a>.</p></li><li>

<p><strong>Custom CSS class name</strong> - You can type the name of a CSS class to allow the Textbox to inherit specific styles defined in the <a href=/low-code/global-css/>Global CSS file</a>.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Mode</strong> - you can decide whether your Text box is limited to a <strong>Single line of text</strong> or will allow for <strong>Multiple lines of text</strong> or can choose <strong>Rich text</strong>. Different additional options will then be shown, depending on the Mode you have chosen.</p><p>If you choose &lsquo;<strong>Single line of text</strong>&rsquo; as the Mode for your Text box - as in the example shown above - these additional options will be shown:</p><ul>

<p><strong>Placeholder</strong> - you can insert placeholder text to appear in the Text box field to assist the user. For example, this Text box field titled &lsquo;Address 1&rsquo; has placeholder text:</p><p><img src=/images/textbox-placeholder.jpg alt="Example of Text box placeholder text"></p></li></ul><p>If you choose &lsquo;<strong>Multiple lines of text</strong>&rsquo; as the Mode for your Text box, these additional options will be shown:</p><p><img src=/images/textbox-multiple-lines-options.jpg alt="Text box multiple lines of text options"></p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Rows</strong> - you can decide how many rows of text you want your Text box to have. Either manually type in a number or use the up/down arrows <img src=/images/up-down-arrows.jpg alt="Up down arrow buttons"> on the right-side of the field</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Max length</strong> - you can set a maximum number of characters for the Text box</p></li><li>

<p><strong>Placeholder</strong> - you can insert placeholder text to appear in the Text box field to assist the user.</p></li></ul><p>If you choose &lsquo;<strong>Rich text</strong>&rsquo; as the Mode for your Text box, you will have the additional options of setting a <strong>Max length</strong> (maximum number of characters that can be input in the field) and choosing a <strong>Text style</strong>, as shown here:</p><p><img src=/images/textbox-richtext-options.jpg alt="Text box Rich text options"></p></li><li>
<p><strong>Expression</strong> - If you want to use your Text box field in a way that is more dynamic, you could decide to add an expression to it. For example, an Expression can be used to return a value - if you apply the Expression &lsquo;<strong>Date()</strong>&rsquo; to your Text box field, it will return the current date and time.</p><p>To add an Expression to your Text box field, click on the ellipsis button <img src=/images/ellipsis.png alt="Ellipsis button in the Expression box"> to the right. This will open the <strong>Expression builder</strong> dialog box:</p><p><img src=/images/expression-builder.jpg alt="Expression builder dialog box"></p><p>You can click on the <strong>Reference</strong> button <img src=/images/reference.png alt="Reference button in the Expression builder dialog box"> to see some of the most commonly used Expressions.

<h1 id=pg-f3ec6799b3e0c55b0f5ec320ffd8f6d0>4.2.7 - Toggle control</h1><p><strong>Toggle fields</strong> (controls) can be used in a form to record a decision, confirm that an action has been taken or an item has been received, or to record a yes/no type answer. They can be used as either a toggle or as a checkbox - for example, Toggle fields could be used to create a series of checkboxes in an Onboarding Form to record whether a new employee has received required training, been assigned an employee number and so on.</p><p>Rules can be applied to <strong>Toggle fields</strong> to make your form more dynamic. One such rule, the <strong>Show, hide or disable rule</strong> can be applied to a Toggle field to have the effect of showing or hiding remaining options/sections in the form dependent on whether the toggle/checkbox is selected or not.</p><p>For example, in a Training Request form, a Toggle field could be used to record a manager&rsquo;s decision to either approve or reject an employee&rsquo;s training request - by applying the <strong>Show, hide or disable</strong> rule to this field, a different last section of the form will display based on the manager&rsquo;s decision. If the manager select&rsquo;s to approve the training, a sign-off button then appears; if the manager reject&rsquo;s the request, a &lsquo;Reason&rsquo; text box appears for them to insert their feedback. To learn more about applying rules to fields, see <a href=/platform/rules/>Rules</a> and <a href=/platform/rules/general/expression-builder>Expression builder</a>.

<li>
<p>To add a <strong>Toggle field</strong> to a form, first open the relevant process.</p></li><li>
<p>Then select the form within that process that you want to add the field to (so that the <strong>Edit Form</strong> button <img src=/images/penicon.png alt="Edit form button"> is visible). If you want to add the Toggle field to a panel within your form, first select the panel by clicking on it and then add the <strong>Toggle field</strong>.</p></li><li>
<p>Insert the new <strong>Toggle field</strong> by clicking on <strong>Controls</strong> in the left-hand pane to expand the Controls menu, then select <strong>Input</strong> to view the range of Input controls and click on <strong>Toggle</strong>.</p><p><img src=/images/toggle-insert.jpg alt="Insert toggle field"></p></li><li>

<li>
<p><strong>Title</strong> - You can change the name of the Toggle field from the default title <strong>Toggle 1</strong>.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Name</strong> - This is a unique name for the field and inherits a camel case version of the entered Title.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Help text</strong> - You can insert text to explain to the form user what selecting the toggle/checkbox means. If you add help text, a question mark <img src=/images/help-icon.jpg alt="Help text icon"> icon will appear next to the field title and, if the user clicks on this, they will see the help text you have inserted. In this example, the Toggle field is titled &lsquo;Approve Training&rsquo; and has associated help text:</p><p><img src=/images/toggle-approve-training.jpg alt="Toggle field help text icon"></p><p><img src=/images/toggle-helptext-example.jpg alt="List field help text example"></p></li><li>
<p><strong>Custom CSS class name</strong> - You can type the name of a CSS class to allow the Toggle to inherit specific styles defined in the <a href=/low-code/global-css/>Global CSS file</a>.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Value when enabled</strong> - You can set the value for when the user selects the toggle/checkbox. For example, the value when it is selected could be &lsquo;Yes&rsquo;.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Value when disabled</strong> - You can set the value for when the user does <em>not</em> select the toggle/checkbox. For example, the value when it is not selected could be &lsquo;No&rsquo;.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Display mode</strong> - You can choose to have the Toggle field display as either a <strong>Toggle button</strong> <img src=/images/toggle-icon.jpg alt="Toggle button icon"> or <strong>Checkbox</strong> <img src=/images/toggle-checkbox-icon.jpg alt="Checkbox icon">.</p></li><li>

<p><strong>Name</strong> - This is a unique name for the field and inherits a camel case version of the entered Title.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Help text</strong> - You can insert text to help the form user to complete the User Picker field. Taking the example of the &lsquo;Manager&rsquo; User picker field in a &lsquo;Training Request&rsquo; form, you could insert help text to this effect:</p><p><img src=/images/user-picker-helptext-example.jpg alt="User picker field help text example dialog box"></p><p>If you add help text, a question mark <img src=/images/help-icon.jpg alt="Help text icon"> icon will appear next to the field title and, if the user clicks on this, they will see the help text you have inserted.</p><p><img src=/images/user-picker-helptext-shown.jpg alt="User picker field help text example icon"></p></li><li>

<p><strong>Selection options</strong> - You can choose what selection options are available to the form user to the right of the User picker field. You can choose to show as many of these three selection options as like: <strong>Users</strong> (all users), <strong>Groups</strong> (such as HR) and <strong>Partners</strong>.</p><p>For example, if you choose to make all three selection options available, your User picker field will have a drop-down menu to the right where the form user can switch between Users, Groups and Partners:</p><p><img src=/images/user-picker-selection-options.jpg alt="Selection options in a User picker field"></p><p><strong>Note</strong>: If you have inserted a Group in the <strong>Member of group</strong> field, this selection will limit the users or groups available to be selected in the User picker field, regardless of what <strong>Selection options</strong> you choose to make available to the form user.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Default selection option</strong> - You can choose to have a certain selection option displayed to the right of the User picker field by default - either <strong>Users</strong>, <strong>Groups</strong> or <strong>Partners</strong>.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Show selection option menu</strong> - You can choose whether or not the selection option menu (where the form user can switch between <strong>Users</strong>, <strong>Groups</strong> and <strong>Partners</strong>) is shown on the right-hand side of the User picker field.</p><p>If you choose <strong>No</strong>, there will not be a selection option menu:</p><p><img src=/images/user-picker-no-options.jpg alt="User picker without selection option menu"></p><p>If you choose <strong>Yes</strong>, a selection option menu will be available to the form user to click (to change the list of users they can select from):</p><p><img src=/images/user-picker-options.jpg alt="User picker field with selection option menu"></p></li><li>

<li>
<p>To add a <strong>Field group</strong> to a form, first open the relevant process - in our case, we will open the Education Request Process.</p></li><li>
<p>Then select the form within that process that you want to add the field to (so that the <strong>Edit Form</strong> button <img src=/images/penicon.png alt="Edit form button"> is visible) - we will select the &lsquo;Training Approval&rsquo; form.

Panels are sections within your form - to learn more, go to <a href=/platform/controls/layout/panel/>Panel control</a>. We will use the <strong>Field group control</strong> to add fields from the &lsquo;Training Request&rsquo; form to the first panel.</p></li><li>

<p><strong>Title</strong> - You can change the title of the Field group from the default title of &lsquo;<strong>Field group 1</strong>&rsquo;.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Name</strong> - This is a unique name for the field and inherits a camel case version of the entered Title.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Help text</strong> - You can insert text to help the form user to complete the Field group - if you add help text, a question mark <img src=/images/help-icon.jpg alt="Help text icon"> icon will appear next to the field title and, if the user clicks on this, they will see the help text you have inserted.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Custom CSS class name</strong> - You can type the name of a CSS class to allow the Field group to inherit specific styles defined in the <a href=/low-code/global-css/>Global CSS file</a>.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Select fields to group or mirror</strong> - You can choose one or more fields from the current process to group or mirror by clicking on the field or fields to select them.

<li>
<p>Select the <strong>Dialog field</strong> and then insert a <strong>Richtext field</strong> into it by clicking <strong>Controls</strong> ><strong>Layout</strong> ><strong>Richtext</strong> in the right-hand pane.

<p>A <strong>New field - Richtext</strong> dialog box will open:</p><p><img src=/images/richtext-dialog2.jpg alt="Richtext dialog box"></p></li><li>
<p><strong>Title</strong> - You can change the title of the Richtext field from the default &lsquo;<strong>Richtext 1</strong>&rsquo;. <strong>Note</strong>: It is the <strong>Dialog field</strong> title that will show as the heading of the pop-up Dialog, not the Richtext title.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Name</strong> - This is a unique name for the field and inherits a camel case version of the entered Title.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Helptext</strong> - You can insert text to help the form user to complete the field - if you add help text, a question mark <img src=/images/help-icon.jpg alt="Help text icon"> icon will appear next to the field title and, if the user clicks on this, they will see the help text you have inserted. This option is not as relevant to the Dialog field as it is to other fields, as the Dialog field is not a field the user needs to complete.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Custom CSS class name</strong> - You can type the name of a CSS class to allow the Richtext to inherit specific styles defined in the <a href=/low-code/global-css/>Global CSS file</a>.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Richtext</strong> - Type the text that you want to be shown as the main body text in the pop-up Dialog into this field and format it as you want - there are options to highlight text, change the font style and font colour, bold, underline, increase or decrease font size, use a bulleted or numbered list, format the text to align left/centre/right, insert a table or a link, insert an image or to switch to code view.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Colour scheme</strong> - You can choose from five colour options for the colour that will appear in the background behind the Dialog richtext body text.</p><p>For our example of the Training Request form, we will insert text to remind the employee completing the form to check that they have completed all fields before submitting it and will choose an orange background colour:</p><p><img src=/images/dialog-richtext-example.jpg alt="Example richtext for Dialog field"></p></li><li>

<h1 id=pg-9ec3d1a55b8cedd4b262974803bc370c>4.3.3 - Panel layout control</h1><p>A <strong>Panel field</strong> is section within a form. Panels hold other elements of your form, such as <a href=/platform/controls/input/textbox/>text box fields</a>, <a href=/platform/controls/input/list/>list fields</a> and <a href=/platform/controls/input/table/>tables</a>, and enable flexible layout options that result in a better end-user experience.</p><p>It is a good idea when first creating a form to insert a panel for each section of your form and then insert the fields you require into each of these panels. One advantage of having related fields contained within a panel is that you can then easily move that panel (and all of the fields within it) to another location within your form.</p><p>For example, in a &lsquo;Training Request&rsquo; form, you may decide to insert two panels - one panel to contain the details relating to the employee requesting the training and a second panel to contain the details of the training course being requested.</p><h2 id=how-to-get-started>How to get started</h2><ol>
<li>
<p>To add a <strong>Panel</strong> to a form, first open the relevant process.</p></li><li>
<p>Then select the form within that process that you want to add the field to (so that the <strong>Edit Form</strong> button <img src=/images/penicon.png alt="Edit form button"> is visible). Go to <a href=/getting-started/create-first-process/>Create First Process</a> to learn how to create your first process.</p></li><li>

<p><strong>Name (unique)</strong> - This is a unique name for the Panel field and inherits a camel case version of the entered Title.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Help text</strong> - You can insert text to help the form user to complete the Panel.</p><p>In our example, we could insert this help text to assist the user in completing the &lsquo;Employee Details&rsquo; panel:</p><p><img src=/images/panel-help-text.jpg alt="Panel help text"></p><p>If you add help text, a question mark <img src=/images/help-icon.jpg alt="Help text icon"> icon will appear next to the Panel title and, if the user clicks on this, they will see the help text you have inserted.</p><p><img src=/images/panel-help-text-shown.jpg alt="Panel help text displayed"></p></li><li>
<p><strong>Custom CSS class name</strong> - You can type the name of a CSS class to allow the panel to inherit specific styles defined in the <a href=/low-code/global-css/>Global CSS file</a>.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Card design?</strong> - This option allows you to add a border radius to your panel, which rounds the edges. If you select the <strong>Yes</strong> radio button, you can choose between defining:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>The total border radius in pixels by clicking the all corners button <img src=/images/card-design-all-symbol.jpg alt="Card design all symbol"> and entering a value into the input field.</p></li><li>
<p>Each corner&rsquo;s border radius individually in pixels by clicking on the individual corners button <img src=/images/card-design-individual-symbol.jpg alt="individual corners button"> and entering values for each corner in the four input fields.</p><p><img src=/images/card-design-individual-pixels.jpg alt="individual corners border radius"></p><p>This feature can give your forms an added level of unique styling.</p><p><img src=/images/card-detail.jpg alt="card detail"></p></li></ul></li><li>
<p><strong>Layout columns</strong> - Here you can decide how wide you want your Panel to be in your form - choose from 1 to 12 columns in width. For example click half-way across the blue bar to create a panel that is 6 columns wide, or click at the far right side of the blue bar to create a column that is 12 columns wide.</p><p><img src=/images/layoutcolumns.png alt="Panel width"></p></li><li>
<p><strong>Colour scheme</strong> - You can choose from six different colour options: navy, green, blue, amber, red, white. By default, the colour is set to white.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Enable panel security</strong> - If you want to restrict who can see the contents of the Panel, choose <strong>Yes</strong>. Two additional options will then be shown - &lsquo;<strong>Add security</strong>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<strong>Allow anonymous link</strong>&rsquo;:</p><p><img src=/images/panel-enable-security.jpg alt="Enable Panel security"></p><p>To limit who can view the Panel contents, click the &lsquo;<strong>Add security</strong>&rsquo; button.

<li>
<p>If you choose <strong>Yes</strong>, this will mean that the Panel will be visible when the form is accessed via an anonymous link.</p></li><li>
<p>If you choose <strong>No</strong>, anyone accessing the form from an anonymous link will not be able to see the Panel.</p></li></ul><p>Anonymous links can be useful if, for example, you want members of the public to complete your form without needing to log into Kianda.

See <a href=/platform/rules/>Rules</a> and <a href=/platform/controls/actions/button/>Button control</a> to learn more.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Link</strong> - Link fields can be used to create custom links to forms. These can be external links. See <a href=/platform/controls/actions/link/>Link control</a> for more information.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Image</strong> - Image fields can be used to display images, either statically or from file fields. Go to <a href=/platform/controls/actions/image/>Image control</a> to find out more.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Signature</strong> - Signature fields provide a very neat way to electronically sign-off on a form or process. To learn more, go to <a href=/platform/controls/actions/signature/>Signature control</a>.</p></li></ul><p>To add an <strong>Action field</strong> to a Kianda form:</p><ol>

Now let&rsquo;s look at each of these Action fields in more detail:</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always>
<h1 id=pg-19c9f91dd7df3fa68126f16c80853cc7>4.4.1 - Button control</h1><p><strong>Button fields</strong> can be used in forms to allow user interface actions. Often, rules are applied to buttons so that actions are automatically executed once the user clicks on the button. In this way, Button fields with rules can be used to trigger a sequence of events. To learn more about rules, go to <a href=/platform/rules/>Rules</a>.</p><p>For example, as part of an Employee Appraisal Process, a manager may complete a Performance Plan form for each employee, setting out their Key Performance Areas and goals. It could be useful to add a button to this form - titled &lsquo;Schedule Meeting&rsquo; - that will automatically schedule a performance review meeting between the manager and the employee at a pre-determined date in the future. We will keep this example in mind as we learn more about using <strong>Button controls</strong>.</p><h2 id=how-to-get-started>How to get started</h2><p>To add a <strong>Button field</strong> to a Kianda form:</p><ol>
<li>
<p>Open an existing process by going to <strong>Administration</strong> > <strong>Designer</strong> in the left side menu and clicking on a process, or create a new process in Designer. See <a href=/getting-started/create-first-process/>Create First Process</a> to learn how to create your first process.</p><p><img src=/images/designer-open-process.jpg alt="Open process in Designer"></p></li><li>
<p>Once you have opened your process, select the form you want to work on (so that the <strong>Edit Form</strong> button <img src=/images/penicon.png alt="Pen icon"> is shown).</p><p>In this example, a Performance Plan form has been selected:</p><p><img src=/images/button-form-selected.jpg alt="Select form"></p></li><li>
<p>Select the area within the form where you want to insert the new <strong>Button field</strong> - in our example, we will select the panel containing the &lsquo;Schedule performance plan review meeting&rsquo; information.</p><p><img src=/images/button-select-area.jpg alt="Select panel to insert Button"></p></li><li>
<p>Click on <strong>Controls</strong> in the left-hand pane, and, from the four categories of Controls (Input, Layout, Actions and Custom), click on <strong>Actions</strong>.</p></li><li>
<p>Select <strong>Button</strong> from the four types of Action fields: Button, Link, Image and Signature:</p><p><img src=/images/button-insert.jpg alt="Actions menu insert Button"></p></li><li>
<p>A <strong>New field - Button</strong> dialog box will automatically open, giving you options for your new Button field:</p><p><img src=/images/button-dialog-new.jpg alt="Button field dialog box"></p></li><li>
<p><strong>Title</strong> - You can change the name of the Button from the default &lsquo;<strong>Button 1</strong>&rsquo;.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Name (Unique)</strong> - This is a unique name for the Button and inherits a camel case version of the entered Title.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Help text</strong> - You can insert text to help the form user. If you add help text, a question mark <img src=/images/help-icon.jpg alt="Help text icon"> icon will appear next to the field title and, if the user clicks on this, they will see the help text you have inserted.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Custom CSS class name</strong> - You can type the name of a CSS class to allow the Button to inherit specific styles defined in the <a href=/low-code/global-css/>Global CSS file</a>.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Button size</strong> - You can choose the size of the Button ranging from XL (extra large) to XS (extra small). By default, the Button size is medium.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Block button</strong> - If you choose <strong>Yes</strong>, the button will span the entire width of the button&rsquo;s allocated space. If you choose <strong>No</strong>, an additional field called <strong>Align button</strong> will appear that allows you to select what direction the Button aligns to. By default, the Button is aligned to the center.</p><p><img src=/images/align-button.jpg alt="align button"></p></li><li>
<p><strong>Color scheme</strong> - You can choose a colour for your new Button field from six options.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Icon</strong> - You can choose an icon to appear on your Button by clicking on the down arrow to the right and scrolling to select the icon you want to use (or can opt not to add an icon).</p></li></ol><p><img src=/images/button-dialog-icon.jpg alt="Button dialog box icon options"></p><ol start=15>
<li>
<p><strong>Show in form body</strong> - Select <strong>Yes</strong> if you want your Button to be shown in the Form.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Enable button security</strong> - Select <strong>Yes</strong> if you want to limit who can see the Button you are adding to the form.</p><p><img src=/images/button-dialog-security.jpg alt="Button dialog box enable button security"></p><p>If you select <strong>Yes</strong>, two additional options are displayed: <strong>Add security</strong> and <strong>Allow anonymous link</strong>.</p><p>When you click on <strong>Add security</strong>, a new line appears with the options <strong>Field security</strong> and <strong>Select user(s) or groups</strong>:</p><p><img src=/images/button-dialog-add-security.jpg alt="Buttons add security"></p><p>In <strong>Field security</strong>, you can choose from <strong>three options in terms of who will be able to view the Button you are inserting</strong>:</p><p><img src=/images/button-dialog-visibility.jpg alt="Button visibility options"></p><p>(i) If you choose to limit the Button visibility to a &lsquo;<strong>User or group</strong>&rsquo;, you can then select the user(s) or groups you want to be able to see the Button in the &lsquo;Select user(s) or groups&rsquo; box.</p><p>(ii) If you choose to limit the Button visibility to a &lsquo;<strong>User picker field</strong>&rsquo;, you then select the User picker field in the &lsquo;Select a userpicker field&rsquo; box:</p><p><img src=/images/button-dialog-user-picker.jpg alt="Button visibility limited to User picker field"></p><p>This will limit the visibility of the Button to the user(s) selected in that User picker field.</p><p>(iii) If you choose to limit the Button visibility to &lsquo;<strong>Form owner(s)</strong>&rsquo;, you then select the form in the &lsquo;Select a form&rsquo; box - only the owner(s) of the selected form will be able to view the new Button you are inserting:</p><p><img src=/images/button-security-form-owner.jpg alt="Button visibility limited to Form owners"></p><p>The second main option in terms of Button security is &lsquo;<strong>Allow anonymous link</strong>&rsquo;:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>If you choose <strong>Yes</strong>, this will mean that the Button field will be visible when the form is accessed via an anonymous link.</p></li><li>
<p>If you choose <strong>No</strong>, anyone accessing the form from an anonymous link will not be able to see the Button field.</p></li></ul><p>Anonymous links can be useful if, for example, you want members of the public to complete your form without needing to log into Kianda. To learn more about how you can create anonymous links to a form that can be shared with external users, see <a href=/platform/rules/communications/anonymous-form-link/>Anonymous form link</a>.</p></li><li>
<p>Once you complete the <strong>New field - Button</strong> dialog box, click <strong>OK</strong> and the new <strong>Button field</strong> is added to your form.</p></li></ol><p>In our example, if we changed the Button field title to &lsquo;Schedule Meeting&rsquo; and chose a green colour scheme and &lsquo;people&rsquo; icon, set button size to small and aligned the button to the right, our new Button could look like this when added to our &lsquo;Performance Plan&rsquo; form:</p><p><img src=/images/button-example-meeting.jpg alt="Button example titled Schedule Meeting"></p><ul>
<li>
<p>You may then decide to add rules to your new <strong>Button field</strong> - to learn more, go to <a href=/platform/rules/>Rules</a>. The rules we add will be executed in the order in which they are listed under <strong>Rules</strong> in the right hand pane.</p><p>For example, we could add a series of rules to our new <strong>Schedule Meeting</strong> button:</p><p><img src=/images/button-example-rules.jpg alt="Button field example with rules"></p><p>In our example, the sixth rule is a Meeting Request rule which will mean that, once the <strong>Schedule Meeting</strong> button is clicked, an automated email will be sent to the employee scheduling a performance review meeting - to learn more, go to <a href=/platform/rules/communications/meeting-request/>Meeting request rule</a>.</p></li></ul><h3 id=how-to-edit-move-and-delete-button-fields>How to edit, move and delete Button fields</h3><p>To edit a <strong>Button field</strong>:</p><ol>

For example, you may wish to insert an image at the top of your form or may wish to enable form users to annotate an image.</p><h2 id=how-to-get-started>How to get started</h2><p>To add an <strong>Image field</strong> to a Kianda form:</p><ol>
<li>
<p>Open an existing process by going to <strong>Administration</strong> > <strong>Designer</strong> in the left side menu and clicking on a process, or create a new process in Designer. See <a href=/getting-started/create-first-process/>Create First Process</a> to learn how to create your first process.</p><p><img src=/images/designer-open-process.jpg alt="Open process in Designer"></p></li><li>
<p>Once you have opened your process, select the form you want to work on (so that the <strong>Edit Form</strong> button <img src=/images/penicon.png alt="Pen icon"> is shown).</p><p>In this example, a Training Approval form in an Education Request Process has been selected:</p><p><img src=/images/image-form-selected.jpg alt="Select form to insert an Image field"></p></li><li>
<p>Select the area within the form where you want to insert the <strong>Image field</strong> - in our example, we will select the first panel in the form - Training Details:</p><p><img src=/images/image-location.jpg alt="Select panel to insert Image field"></p></li><li>
<p>Click on <strong>Controls</strong> in the left-hand pane, and, from the four categories of Controls (Input, Layout, Actions and Custom), click on <strong>Actions</strong>.</p></li><li>
<p>Select <strong>Image</strong> from the four types of Action fields: Button, Link, Image and Signature:</p><p><img src=/images/image-insert.jpg alt="Actions menu insert Image"></p></li><li>
<p>A <strong>New field - Image</strong> dialog box will automatically open, giving you options for your new Image field:</p><p><img src=/images/image-dialog2.jpg alt="Image field dialog box"></p></li><li>
<p><strong>Title</strong> - You can change the name of the Image field from the default &lsquo;<strong>Image 1</strong>&rsquo;. In our example, we could change the title to &lsquo;Employees&rsquo;.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Name (Unique)</strong> - This is a unique name for the new field and inherits a camel case version of the entered Title.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Help text</strong> - You can insert text to help the form user. If you add help text, a question mark <img src=/images/help-icon.jpg alt="Help text icon"> icon will appear next to the field title and, if the user clicks on this, they will see the help text you have inserted.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Custom CSS class name</strong> - You can type the name of a CSS class to allow the Image to inherit specific styles defined in the <a href=/low-code/global-css/>Global CSS file</a>.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Image source</strong> - You can choose to insert the image either from an <strong>Image URL</strong> or from a <strong>File field</strong> within the form. Different additional options will be available to you, dependent on the Image source you choose.</p><p>(i) If you choose <strong>Image URL</strong> as the Image source, insert the URL for the image into the <strong>Image URL</strong> field:</p><p><img src=/images/image-url.jpg alt="Image source Image URL"></p><p>Then complete the <strong>Image max height</strong> and <strong>Image max width</strong> options:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Image max height</strong> - Insert the maximum height (in pixels) for your new Image field by either manually inserting a number or using the up down arrows <img src=/images/up-down-arrows.jpg alt="Up down arrows buttons"> to the right of the field.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Image max width</strong> - Insert the maximum width (in pixels) for your new Image field by either manually inserting a number or using the up down arrows <img src=/images/up-down-arrows.jpg alt="Up down arrows buttons"> to the right of the field.</p></li></ul><p>When you&rsquo;ve completed the New field - Image dialog box and clicked <strong>OK</strong>, your new Image field will be inserted at the bottom of the area you selected - in our case, at the bottom of the first panel in the Training Approval form:</p><p><img src=/images/image-url-example.jpg alt="Image field inserted with URL as Image source"></p><p>(ii) If you choose <strong>File field</strong> as the <strong>Image source</strong>, three additional options will be displayed below the &lsquo;Image max height&rsquo; and &lsquo;Image max width&rsquo; options - <strong>Enable image annotations</strong>, <strong>Display images inline</strong> and <strong>Enable quick remove image</strong>:</p><p><img src=/images/image-file-field-options.jpg alt="Image source File field"></p><p>To use a <strong>File field</strong> as the <strong>Image source</strong>, you must first have inserted a <strong>File Upload field</strong> into your form and it must hold an image file.</p><p>In our example, you could insert a File Upload field titled &lsquo;Image file&rsquo; into the panel where you want to insert the new Image field and then browse to find an image you have saved on your computer:</p><p><img src=/images/image-file-upload-field.jpg alt="Insert File upload field to hold an image"></p><p>You could choose to make this File Upload field <strong>invisible to form users</strong>, by ensuring the <strong>Visible</strong> checkbox is not selected in the Field Properties menu to the right.</p><p>If you want to allow form users to make annotations on the Image, make sure to select <strong>Yes</strong> to the <strong>Allow file override</strong> option in the <strong>New field - File</strong> dialog box. To learn more about File Upload fields, see <a href=/platform/controls/input/file-upload/>File Upload field</a>.</p><p>Once the File Upload field has been added to the form and it contains the image file you want to use, you can then insert an <strong>Image field</strong> and, in the dialog box, choose <strong>File field</strong> as your <strong>Image source</strong>, click into the File field and select the field containing the image:</p><p><img src=/images/image-file-field-select.jpg alt="Image with File field as Image source"></p><p>Then complete the <strong>Image max height</strong> and <strong>Image max width</strong> fields:</p><p><img src=/images/image-file-field-height-width.jpg alt="Image source as File field and max height and max width inserted"></p><p>In our example, if we inserted an <strong>Image field</strong> using a <strong>File field</strong> as the Image source (and choose not to make the File field visible to form users), the new Image field could look like this once inserted in our form:</p><p><img src=/images/image-file-field-example.jpg alt="Image example inserted using a File field as the Image Source"></p><p>You have three additional options if you choose <strong>File field</strong> as your Image source:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Enable image annotations</strong> - If you choose <strong>Yes</strong>, this will enable both you (as the Form Designer) and the end user (the form user) to make annotations to the Image - such as adding a text comment or inserting a shape.</p><p>To make annotations to the Image as the Form Designer, choose <strong>Yes</strong> to &lsquo;Enable image annotations&rsquo; and after clicking <strong>OK</strong> at the bottom of the <strong>New field - Image</strong> dialog box, click on the new <strong>Image field</strong> that has been added to your form:</p><p><img src=/images/image-annotations-designer.jpg alt="Click on image to annotate as form designer"></p><p>When you click on the Image, a new pop-up box will open, with an <strong>Annotate Image</strong> button at the top right:</p><p><img src=/images/image-annotate-designer.jpg alt="Click on image to annotate and Annotate button displays"></p><p>Click on this Annotate Image button and a menu will display with a range of options for annotating the image:</p><p><img src=/images/image-annotate-menu.jpg alt="Menu for annotating an Image field"></p><p>The options available for annotating the image include:</p><p>​ - <strong>Undo the last annotation</strong> <img src=/images/image-annotate-undo.jpg alt="Image annotation undo button"></p><p>​ - <strong>Draw a rectangle</strong> <img src=/images/image-annotate-rectangle.jpg alt="Image annotation draw a rectangle button"></p><p>​ - <strong>Draw a circle</strong> <img src=/images/image-annotate-circle.jpg alt="Image annotation draw a circle"></p><p>​ - <strong>Write some text</strong> <img src=/images/image-annotate-text.jpg alt="Image annotation Write some text button"></p><p>​ - <strong>Draw an arrow</strong> <img src=/images/image-annotate-arrow.jpg alt="Image annotation draw an arrow button"></p><p>​ - <strong>Pen tool</strong> <img src=/images/image-annotate-pen.jpg alt="Image annotation pen tool button"> (which allows you to do a free hand drawing on the image)</p><p>​ - <strong>Redo the last undone annotation</strong> <img src=/images/image-annotate-redo.jpg alt="Image annotation Redo last undone annotation button"></p><p>An end user completing the form will be able to make annotations to the image in the same way - by clicking on the Image in the form and then clicking the Annotate Image button to view the menu.</p><p>When you have made the changes you want to the image, click on the green <strong>Save</strong> button <img src=/images/image-annotate-save.jpg alt="Image annotation green Save button">. This annotation will then be visible in the image in your form.</p><p>If you choose <strong>Yes</strong> to <strong>Enable image annotations</strong>, another option is shown - <strong>Keep original image</strong>:</p><p><img src=/images/image-annotations.jpg alt="Enable image annotations Keep original image sub-option"></p><p>If you choose <strong>Yes</strong> for <strong>Keep original image</strong>, when the Image field is annotated, both the original image and annotated image will be shown side by side and will both be saved in the location you chose as the &lsquo;Destination&rsquo; in the File Upload field.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Display images inline</strong> - Select <strong>Yes</strong> if you want the Image field to appear in line with the text in your form.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Enable quick remove image</strong> - If you select <strong>Yes</strong>, a <strong>Bin/Trash</strong> button <img src=/images/binicon.png alt="Bin icon"> will be available to the form user at the bottom of the Image field in the form, enabling them to delete the image by clicking on it.</p><p><img src=/images/image-quick-remove.jpg alt="Image quick remove button"></p></li></ul></li><li>
<p>When you have finished selecting the options you want for your new <strong>Image field</strong> in the <strong>New field - Image</strong> dialog box, click <strong>OK</strong> and the Image will be added to your form.</p></li><li>
<p>You can preview how the image will look to an end user by first saving the changes you&rsquo;ve made to your form (by clicking on the <strong>Save</strong> button <img src=/images/saveprocess.png alt=Save>) and then clicking the <strong>Preview</strong> <img src=/images/preview.png alt="Preview button"> button.</p><p>In our example, if we added an <strong>Image field</strong> to our Training Approval form and choose a File field as the Image source and to allow the user to make annotations to the image - it could look like this to user completing the form on their mobile phone:</p><p><img src=/images/image-preview-mobile.jpg alt="Preview Image field on a mobile phone"></p><p>If you chose to enable image annotations, the form user can click on the image, click on the <strong>Annotate image</strong> button <img src=/images/image-annotate-icon.jpg alt="Annotate image button"> and then use the options in the menu to make annotations on the image and save these.</p></li></ol><h3 id=how-to-edit-move-and-delete-image-fields>How to edit, move and delete Image fields</h3><p>To edit an <strong>Image field</strong>:</p><ol>

<p><strong>Signature pad height (pixels)</strong> - You can choose the height of the signature in pixels. To do this, either manually type in the number of pixels you want the height to be or use the up and down arrows <img src=/images/up-down-arrows.jpg alt="Up down arrows"> to the right.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Signature color</strong> - You can choose the colour for the signature itself, i.e. the name of the user electronically signing the form. To do this, click on the field and then either:</p><p>(i) use the slider to move between colours and click on the palette to choose a particular hue</p><p>(ii) click on the dropper icon <img src=/images/signature-dropper.jpg alt="Signature colour dropper icon"> and then choose a colour from your open PC window(s)</p><p>(iii) type in the R G B value if you know the colour you want to use</p><p><img src=/images/signature-colour.jpg alt="Signature colour"></p></li><li>
<p><strong>Signature thickness</strong> - Insert a numerical value for how thick you want the signature font to be. By default, this is set to 2.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Start signing button text</strong> - You can choose the text you want to appear on the Signature field button. By default, the text is &lsquo;Start Signing&rsquo; but you can change this to whatever you want.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Re-Sign button text</strong> - You can choose the text you want to appear on the &lsquo;Re-Sign&rsquo; button. This &lsquo;Re-Sign&rsquo; button appears after the user has clicked the Start signing button and completed the dialog box and it enables the user to replace or override the original signature they input. By default, the text is &lsquo;Re-sign&rsquo; but you can change this to whatever you want.</p><p>In our example of adding a Signature field titled &lsquo;Manager Signature&rsquo;, once the manager has signed, the &lsquo;Re-sign&rsquo; button will be shown:</p><p><img src=/images/signature-resign.jpg alt="Re-sign button showing after completing Signature field"></p></li><li>
<p><strong>Show username and signing time</strong> - Select <strong>Yes</strong> to show the Kianda username of the person who has electronically signed with the Signature field and the time they signed at (per the local time settings on the user&rsquo;s Kianda account).</p><p><img src=/images/signature-username-time.jpg alt="Signature showing username and signing time"></p></li><li>
<p><strong>Require user authentication</strong> - Select <strong>Yes</strong> to require user authentication for the user clicking the Signature field button to sign the section/form. If you select Yes, an additional option will display - <strong>Authenticate via SSO</strong>.</p><p><img src=/images/signature-user-authentication.jpg alt="Signature user authentication option"></p><p>If you then choose <strong>Yes</strong> for authenticating the user via Single Sign-on, an initial pop-up box will appear to check whether the user is signed in and, after clicking on the Signature button a second pop-up will appear to confirm the user&rsquo;s credentials.</p><p>If you choose <strong>No</strong> for <strong>Authenticate via SSO</strong>, a pop-up appears requiring the user to confirm their login credentials.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Hide sign by textbox</strong> - Select <strong>Yes</strong> if you want to hide the sign by textbox.</p><p>For example, if we choose <strong>Yes</strong> for this option for our new &lsquo;Manager Signature&rsquo;, when the user clicks the &lsquo;Start signing&rsquo; button and the pop-up box opens, they will just see an area where they can either choose Signature (with an electronically generated signature) or Draw or Upload (to draw or upload their signature):</p><p><img src=/images/signature-hide-sign-by.jpg alt="Signature pop up with sign by textbox hidden"></p><p>If we choose <strong>No</strong> to <strong>Hide sign by textbox</strong>, when the user clicks Start signing they will see a &lsquo;Sign by&rsquo; textbox at the top of the pop-up that appears:</p><p><img src=/images/signature-sign-by.jpg alt="Signature pop up including Sign by textbox"></p></li><li>
<p><strong>Allow override sign by</strong> - Select <strong>Yes</strong> if you want to allow override of the signature inserted in the Signature field. If you choose Yes, an additional option will be shown - <strong>Default title of sign by</strong>:</p><p><img src=/images/signature-override.jpg alt="Signature field allow override sign by option"></p><p>If you select <strong>Yes</strong> to &lsquo;Allow override sign by&rsquo; and then click into the &lsquo;<strong>Default title of sign by</strong>&rsquo; field, you can then select a field to be used to populate the default name in the Signature field. For example, you could select a <a href=/platform/controls/input/user-picker/>User picker field</a> within your form as the &lsquo;Default title of sign by&rsquo; - this would then mean that the user that is selected in that User picker field will be the default name shown in the Signature field.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Hide default signature tab</strong> - Select <strong>Yes</strong> if you want to hide the default signature tab (where an electronic signature is automatically generated). If you choose Yes, the next option - <strong>Auto save signature</strong> - will no longer be available to you.</p><p>In our example, if we select <strong>No</strong> to hiding the default signature tab, the user will see the electronically generated signature:</p><p><img src=/images/signature-default-signature.jpg alt="Default signature tab shown"></p></li><li>
<p><strong>Auto save signature</strong> - Select <strong>Yes</strong> if you want to auto save the signature.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Button icon</strong> - You can choose an icon to appear on your Signature field button (or can opt not to have an icon on it). Click on the down arrow to the right of the field and select the icon you want from several hundred icons in the dropdown list.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Button color</strong> - Choose the colour you want for your Signature field button. The options are Navy, Green, Blue, Amber, Red or White.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Sign dialog button text</strong> - You can choose the text to appear on the button at the bottom right of the Signature dialog box. By default, the text is &lsquo;OK&rsquo; but you can change this to whatever you want.</p></li><li>
<p>Once you complete the <strong>New field - Signature</strong> dialog box, click <strong>OK</strong> and the new <strong>Signature field</strong> will be added to your form.</p><p>In our example, if we insert a new Signature field titled &lsquo;Manager Signature&rsquo;, it will be added to the bottom of the Performance Plan form and look like this:</p><p><img src=/images/signature-inserted-no-title.jpg alt="Inserted Signature field"></p></li><li>
<p>By default, the <strong>Title</strong> of the new <strong>Signature field</strong> will not be shown but you can change this by selecting the the field and checking the <strong>Show title</strong> checkbox in the <strong>Field properties</strong> menu to the right.</p><p><img src=/images/signature-show-title.jpg alt="Show Signature field title"></p></li><li>
<p>You can then click on the new <strong>Signature field</strong> within the form to see how it will appear to users.</p><p>In our case, we can click on the &lsquo;<strong>Start Signing</strong>&rsquo; Manager Signature button to see the dialog box that will appear when the form user clicks on it:</p><p><img src=/images/signature-preview-dialog.jpg alt="Signature preview dialog box"></p><p>The user can choose between a system-created <strong>Signature</strong> or to <strong>Draw or Upload</strong> their own version. If you click on <strong>Draw or Upload</strong> you can see how the user can either sign on the dotted line (and click on <strong>Clear</strong> at any stage to erase a mistake) or click on <strong>Upload handwritten signature</strong> and browse for a file.</p><p><img src=/images/signature-draw-or-upload.jpg alt="Signature Draw or Upload option"></p><p>Click on the <strong>OK</strong> button to close the dialog box.</p></li><li>
<p>You may decide to add rules to your <strong>Signature field</strong> - to learn more about the different categories of rules available, go to <a href=/platform/rules/>Rules</a>. The rules we add will be executed in the order in which they are listed under <strong>Rules</strong> in the right hand pane.</p></li></ol><h3 id=how-to-edit-move-and-delete-signature-fields>How to edit, move and delete Signature fields</h3><p>To edit a <strong>Signature field</strong>:</p><ol>

They represent the actual actions users intend to perform when they interact with form components. There are 60 rules you can apply to forms, see <a href=#rules-list>Rules list</a>.</p><p>There are two key principles to consider when working with forms:</p><ol>
<li>
<p><a href=#rule-design>Rule design</a> - you can decide what type of rule you are going to apply and where, as a rule can be applied at field/control level, form level and process level. For the latter the rule will execute &lsquo;onload&rsquo; that is when the process instance is initiated.</p></li><li>
<p><a href=#rule-order>Rule order</a> - if there are several rules attached to an item like a button, then the order of execution is important and can be modified to suit your needs.</p></li></ol><p>These principles are explained in more in the next section on <a href=#how-to-get-started>How to get started</a>.</p><h2 id=how-to-get-started>How to get started</h2><p>If you have the role <strong>Administrator</strong> or <strong>Design business process</strong>, go to <strong>Administration</strong> > <strong>Designer</strong> and click on a process or create a new process, the predefined rules are found in the left-hand pane under <strong>Add a rule</strong>.</p><p><img src=/images/rulesgeneral.png alt=Rules></p><p>There are 10 categories of rules:</p><ol>
<li><strong>Workflow</strong> - rules that represent the actions a user intends to perform when they interact with form components. These rules enable you to execute actions that can change the flow of information within a process. There are 7 workflow rules, see <a href=/platform/rules/workflow/>Workflow</a> for more information.</li><li><strong>Communications</strong> - rules associated with user communication for example sending an email, meeting request or triggering a user alert. There are 4 communication rules, see <a href=/platform/rules/communications/>Communications</a> for more information.</li><li><strong>Data</strong> - rules associated with database operations such as Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) allowing these actions to occur on configured data sources. There are 5 data rules, see <a href=/platform/rules/data/>Data</a> for more information.</li><li><strong>Users</strong> - rules associated with user properties, allowing user lookup based on a user attribute or retrieve a user property. There are 4 user rules, see <a href=/platform/rules/users/>Users</a> for more information.</li><li><strong>File management</strong> - rules concerned with generating documents such as Word, Excel or converting to PDF. There are 7 file management rules, see <a href=/platform/rules/files/>File Management</a> for more information.</li><li><strong>Tables</strong> - rules associated with table operations such as sorting, copying table rows to another table, adding and removing table rows. There are 12 table rules, see <a href=/platform/rules/tables/>Tables</a> for more information.</li><li><strong>Dates</strong> - date rules to calculate time and format dates with advanced filter options like omitting weekends or special dates. There are 4 date rules, see <a href=/platform/rules/dates/>Dates</a> for more information.</li><li><strong>Form actions</strong> - rules linked to actions that are part of forms, for example submit, close or save. There are 6 form rules, see <a href=/platform/rules/form-actions/>Form actions</a> for more information.</li><li><strong>SharePoint</strong> - SharePoint associated rules such as adding, finding or removing users, defining permissions and check-in/checkout of an item. There are 10 SharePoint rules, see <a href=/platform/rules/sharepoint/>SharePoint</a> for more information.</li><li><strong>Kianda AI</strong> - there is 1 Kianda AI rule related to text analysis, see <a href=/platform/rules/kianda-ai/>Kianda AI</a> for more information.</li></ol><h2 id=rule-design>Rule design</h2><p>You can apply rules at button, field, and form level. At form level, rule(s) execute &lsquo;on load&rsquo;, that is when a process instance is initiated or kicked off for example as a result of a user creating a new instance from a <a href=/platform/pages/>dashboard</a>, or automated through a <a href=/platform/administration/scheduledtasks/>scheduled task</a>, then the rules are triggered into action when the form(s) within that process becomes the active form(s).</p><p>To get started with rule design:</p><ol>
<li>
<p>Click on an existing process or create a new process by going to <strong>Administration</strong> in the left-hand side menu and then click on <strong>Designer</strong>.</p></li><li>
<p>For existing processes and forms, decide which <strong>process</strong>, <strong>form</strong> or <strong>field</strong> you will apply the rule to by clicking on that item so that it is in <strong>edit mode</strong> so you can see the Pen button, <strong>Pen</strong> button <img src=/images/penicon.png alt="Pen button"> for example a form Training Approval or Submit button. For new processes, add in forms and fields and select an element to add a rule to.</p><p><img src=/images/formvsbutton.png alt="Edit mode for forms and fields"></p></li><li>
<p>Click on <strong>Add a rule</strong> in the left-hand pane and click on a category of choice, such as <strong>Communications</strong> and then a rule, for example <strong>User alert</strong>.</p><p><img src=/images/rule-design-example.jpg alt="Rule design example"></p></li><li>
<p>When you have chosen your rule, an <strong>Edit rule</strong> dialog box opens allowing you to configure the rule to execute a particular action, which can be according to <a href=/platform/rules/general/add-conditions/>conditions</a> if you wish.</p></li></ol><p>The links at the end of this page will bring you to the different rule categories and from there you can navigate to rule pages to learn what each parameter is in the <strong>Edit rule</strong> dialog box for each rule. The next section highlights where rules can be applied.</p><h3 id=where-to-apply-rules>Where to apply rules</h3><p>As introduced in the section above, rules can be added at <strong>process</strong>, <strong>form</strong> and <strong>control/field</strong> level, and are typically used as follows, bearing in mind that <a href=/platform/rules/general/add-conditions/>Conditions</a> can be applied to rules to control how the rules are executed:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>A rule applied at <strong>process level</strong> executes &lsquo;onload&rsquo; meaning that when a new process instance is initiated, the rule will automatically execute, for example when someone opens a form, a &lsquo;Send email&rsquo; rule could be used to send an email to someone notifying them that a form has been opened.</p></li><li>
<p>A rule applied at <strong>form level</strong> executes when the form is submitted.</p></li><li>
<p>A rule applied at <strong>control level</strong> executes when the chosen field is clicked on, or involved in user or system interaction.</p><p>As with all rules, <a href=/platform/rules/general/add-conditions/>Conditions</a> within the rule determine how the rule is triggered, for example a rule applied to a control like a date field, may be executed only if a certain value is input into another field within a form.</p></li></ul><h4 id=edit-rule-dialog-box>Edit rule dialog box</h4><p>Whenever a rule is added, the <strong>Edit rule dialog box</strong> will remind you where and at what level the rule is being applied, for example in the image below a <strong>Send email</strong> rule is being added to a button/control called <strong>Submit</strong>.</p><p><img src=/images/rule-applied-dialog-box.jpg alt="Where a rule is applied notice in an Edit rule dialog box"></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Make sure that you save the process after adding forms and/or controls and before adding rules so that the names of the processes, forms or controls are committed to the Kianda database.

<h1 id=pg-9d61c50f58370cccc619c021ac02f668>5.1 - General rule concepts</h1><p>Rules are an important component of any process as they can be used to trigger automated actions, requiring minimal user management once created. There are 60 predefined rules in Kianda covering workflow applications, communications and file management to name a few.</p><h2 id=categories-of-rules>Categories of rules</h2><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Workflow</strong> - Enables you to execute actions that might change the flow of the information within a process.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Communications</strong> - Enables sending emails or meeting requests or even user (push) notifications.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Data</strong> - This is an important and flexible rule group because it allows you to configure CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) actions to configured data sources.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Users</strong> - This enables you to retrieve a user property, updating user properties or lookup for a user based on a user attribute.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>File management</strong> - Allows operations such as the generation of a word document and conversion to PDF and more.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Tables</strong> - Provides specialised rules to enable working with tables like sorting, copying table rows to another table and more.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Dates</strong> - Enables convenient date calculation with advanced options like ignoring weekends or special dates.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Form actions</strong> - Allows operations like submit, save, close and delete forms.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>SharePoint</strong> - Provides a variety of operations to be performed on the SharePoint connection. These rules include operations like create a list, find a user, define permission to an item, check-in / out an item or adding a user to a SharePoint group.</p></li></ul><h2 id=working-with-rules>Working with rules</h2><p>The following headings step through how to view, add, copy, edit and disable rules in processes.

<li>
<p>Select the field or form that contains a rule, for example a button at the end of a form. If a field within a form has rules attached to it, this will be indicated within the form, as shown in the example below where the column <strong>Instances</strong> has <strong>1 rule</strong> attached.</p><p><img src=/images/rule-on-a-field.jpg alt="Rule attached to a form field"></p></li><li>
<p>Under <strong>Rules</strong> in the right-hand pane, click on the given <strong>rule name</strong> to view the rule details, for example a &lsquo;Set form&rsquo; rule called &lsquo;Set link&rsquo; as shown below.</p><p><img src=/images/view-rule.jpg alt="View rule details"></p></li><li>
<p>Details of the rule are available in the <strong>Edit rule</strong> dialog box, for example the <strong>Set form field</strong> rule is shown below.<br>

<p>Under <strong>Rules</strong> in the right-hand pane, click on the <strong>Duplicate rule</strong> <img src=/images/duplicate-rule.jpg alt="Duplicate rule"> button next to the rule name.</p></li><li>
<p>Choose <strong>Copy to another field</strong> if you wish to copy to another field and select the field you want to copy to. Select <strong>OK</strong> when complete.</p></li><li>
<p>Alternatively select <strong>OK</strong> without copying to another field or click on <strong>Close</strong> at any time to exit the dialog box.</p></li></ol><h3 id=how-to-edit-a-rule>How to edit a rule</h3><p>Follow the steps to <a href=#how-to-view-a-rule>View an existing rule</a> to open the <strong>Edit rule</strong> dialog box.</p><p>In the Edit rule dialog box, you can change:</p><ol>
<li>The <strong>Title</strong> of the rule</li><li>Create or edit conditions for the rule by clicking on the <strong>Edit conditions</strong> button.</li><li>Change how the rule performs by changing details under <strong>Action</strong>. Actions will differ depending on the rule in use.</li></ol><h3 id=how-to-disable-a-rule>How to disable a rule</h3><p>Disabling a rule means that the rule is not active but is still visible in the <strong>Rules</strong> pane. The rule can be activated at any time again by clicking on the toggle button.</p><ol>
<li>
<p>Select the field that contains a rule, for example a button at the end of a form, or a field within a form that has rules attached.</p></li><li>
<p>Under <strong>Rules</strong> in the right-hand pane, beside the given <strong>rule name</strong> slide the toggle button from &lsquo;on&rsquo; to &lsquo;off&rsquo; to view the rule details, for example a &lsquo;Set form&rsquo; rule called &lsquo;Set link&rsquo; as shown below.</p><p><img src=/images/rule-disabled.jpg alt="Rule disabled"></p></li><li>
<p>To enable the rule at any time again follow the steps above and slide the toggle button into the &lsquo;on&rsquo; position.</p><p><img src=/images/rule-enabled.jpg alt="Rule enabled"></p></li></ol><h3 id=where-to-place-a-rule-in-a-list-of-rules>Where to place a rule in a list of rules</h3><p>The rule order refers to the order of execution of multiple rules. To change the rule order:</p><ol>
<li>
<p>Select the field with the rules attached.</p></li><li>
<p>Under <strong>Rules</strong> in the right-hand pane, drag and drop the rules in the order you want them.</p></li><li>
<p>The top-most rule is the first rule to be executed. By default buttons at the end of a form will automatically have <strong>Submit</strong>, <strong>Save</strong>, and <strong>Close</strong> rules. If you create rules you may wish to have these rules placed <strong>above</strong> these shutdown rules so that your rules are executed first before form shutdown.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Rule order becomes important when the output of one rule impacts the execution of another, for example if a process remains &lsquo;open&rsquo; because a user must perform a particular action, then it is useful to have an automated email reminder sent to the user while the process is open. For example
the order of rules on a <strong>Submit</strong> button could be: Set Status, Send Email, Submit, Save, Close, whereby the status of the process instance is set first, before an automated email and then the form shutdown rules of Submit, Save and Close occur.</p><p>To read more about multiple rules, go to <a href=/platform/rules/general/multiple-rules/>Multiple rules</a>.</p></li></ol><h2 id=conditions>Conditions</h2><p>Flexible and dynamic conditions form an important component to make forms fully dynamic. This feature enables you to create natural language conditions when rules should be triggered.</p><p><img src=/images/condition-editor.png alt="Condition Editor"></p><p>To configure a rule to conditionally execute an action:</p><ol>
<li>Select the field or form that the rule will be attached to.</li><li>Under <strong>Add a rule</strong> in the left-hand pane, click on a <strong>category</strong> of rules, for example <strong>Workflow</strong> and then a rule itself, for example <strong>Process security</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Edit conditions</strong> button within the rule.</li><li>Add the conditions that satisfy your scenario. Multiple conditions can be grouped with condition groups.</li></ol><p>For more information on Conditions, go to the <a href=/platform/rules/general/add-conditions/>Conditions</a> page.</p><h2 id=custom-rules>Custom rules</h2><p>Under custom rules, you will find any custom-developed rules available under your developer section. Custom rules provide access to rules that are built for extensibility of Kianda capabilities. This is particularly used in situations when existing rules do not provide the required functionality.</p><p>Custom rules have the purpose of providing a user interface for the end-users. If you need to <strong>build a rule</strong> then you should use a custom rule widget.</p><p>It allows a developer to quickly build a reusable component that would then be used by process designers in real processes.</p><p>Check-out the <a href=/getting-started/welcome/low-code/>development</a> section for more details on how to build custom widgets in Kianda.</p><h3 id=whats-next--idea-iconimages18png>What&rsquo;s next <img src=/images/18.png alt="Idea icon"></h3><p>We have briefly introduced the key concepts of rules. Click on the links below to read more about rule concepts in detail:</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always>
<h1 id=pg-c73b7a3f718b3435b4c82d05ab02cedc>5.1.1 - Adding Conditions</h1><p>Conditions are a key component of Kianda <strong>rules</strong>. They are the <strong>triggers</strong> that result in fully dynamic forms. Conditions enable you to create natural language conditions when rules should be triggered.</p><p>The <strong>Conditions</strong> button <img src=https://academy.kianda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/condition.png alt=img> is found within all <strong>rules</strong> as well as <a href=/platform/pages/>dashboard widgets</a>. Conditions can also be set when setting data source security levels for <a href=/platform/b2b-portals/data-access/>B2B portals</a>.</p><p>Conditions add an important level of interactivity, creating dynamic pathways within a process. These pathways could result from user interaction or from other events that happen.</p><p>Conditions work on the ‘if…then’ principle: ‘if’ the condition exists ‘then’ an action happens, and where applicable, if the condition does not exist, then another action can happen. You can use these principles as steps to implementing conditions:</p><ol>
<li>Create the <strong>condition(s)</strong></li><li>Create the <strong>action(s)</strong> that will be applied as a result of the first condition being in place.</li><li>Where applicable, create the <strong>otherwise action(s)</strong> based on other conditions being in place.</li></ol><h2 id=create-the-condition>Create the condition</h2><ol>
<li>
<p>To create <strong>conditions</strong>, first choose the <strong>process element</strong> you want the condition to apply to – such as a form, set of forms, a field/control or set of fields. This could also be a set of common fields associated with all process instances, such as <strong>Process ID</strong>, <strong>Status</strong> or <strong>Modified by</strong>, see image below.</p><p><img src=/images/common-fields-in-condition.jpg alt="Common fields used in the process element part of a condition"></p></li><li>
<p>Next, depending on whether the rule is applied to <strong>text-based fields, date fields or user picker fields</strong>, choose from 13 text operators, 25 date operators and one additional user picker operator, as shown in the image below.</p></li><li>
<p>Then choose a <strong>value</strong>, this could be typed in text, number(s), date(s), form(s) or field(s).</p></li></ol><p><em><strong>Condition elements</strong></em></p><p><img src=/images/condition-operators.jpg alt="Condition elements"></p><p>In the case of <strong>multiple conditions</strong>, you can use <strong>And</strong> or <strong>Or</strong> to create a group of compound conditions:</p><p><img src=https://academy.kianda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/editconditions-1.gif alt=img></p><p>The result is a flexible process workflow that will result in desired actions based on any number of conditions.</p><h3 id=rule-actions--example-hide-or-disable-rule>Rule action(s) – example Hide or Disable rule</h3><p>To create <strong>actions</strong> and where applicable, <strong>otherwise actions</strong>, the <strong>action will depend on the rule</strong> that is chosen. All Kianda rules use a natural language structure to make it is easy to apply actions. For example, for the <strong>Workflow rule</strong>, <strong>Hide or Disable</strong>, you can choose forms and fields from your process and then apply seven possible actions (as shown below).</p><p><strong>Action elements for Hide or Disable</strong></p><p><img src=https://academy.kianda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/hideoptions-1024x477.gif alt="7 actions for Hide or Disable"></p><p>The actions within <strong>Hide or disable</strong> are:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Hide</strong> will hide a process element (forms or fields) from view.</li><li><strong>Show</strong> will show the element.</li><li><strong>Disable</strong> blocks a user from editing an element.</li><li><strong>Enable</strong> allows a user to add a value to an element.</li><li><strong>Toggle visible</strong> will toggle between showing an element or not, based on subsequent clicks of a field that the rule is applied to.</li><li><strong>Toggle enable</strong> will toggle between allowing an element to be edited or not, based on subsequent clicks of a field that the rule is applied to.</li><li><strong>Hide and clear</strong> will allow you to hide a process element and clear the details. For example, if a toggle button has this rule applied, with an <strong>otherwise action</strong> of <strong>show</strong> on a textbox, then if one value is chosen on the toggle button, the user is allowed enter details into the textbox. The otherwise action is that the field is hidden and cleared of data, so that no data can be retrieved. This might be useful, for example, when sensitive information is used, like a social security number on a form.</li></ul><p><strong>Note</strong>: You can use rules to create <strong>actions</strong> <strong>without conditions</strong> too. In this case the rule will simply execute, for example when a form or field is clicked on.</p><h3 id=whats-next--idea-iconimages18png>What&rsquo;s next <img src=/images/18.png alt="Idea icon"></h3><p>Depending on how the rule is applied, for example to a <strong>Submit</strong> button, the rule order is important to consider, see <a href=/platform/rules/general/multiple-rules/>Multiple rules</a>.</p><p>To find out more about rule implementation, go to the main <a href=/platform/rules/>Rules</a> page and then click on the links to the different rule categories.</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always>
<h1 id=pg-1927f40a06bc75f5a1530e2a2012e2b5>5.1.2 - Multiple rules</h1><h2 id=introduction>Introduction</h2><p>When working with rules in forms, a key principle to consider is <strong>rule order</strong>. Rule order is important if there are <strong>multiple rules</strong> attached to an item like a button or form field to determine the sequence of rule execution. As a form designer, you can change the order of execution to suit your specific process design.</p><p>Remember you can assign rules at:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Process level</strong> - onload rules that execute when a new process instance is initiated.</p><p><img src=/images/process-level-rule-example.jpg alt="Process level rule example"></p></li><li>
<p><strong>Form level</strong> - onload rules that execute when a form is submitted.</p><p><img src=/images/form-level-rule.jpg alt="Form level rules"></p></li><li>
<p><strong>Button/field level</strong> - rules attached to buttons or fields within forms, or at the end of a form, for example a Submit button. An example of rule order is given at this level in the section below <a href=#rule-order-example>Rule order example</a>.</p></li></ul><p>Rules are typically synchronously executed in Kianda, so for example when using a <a href=/platform/rules/workflow/start-a-process/>Start a process</a> rule, when the rule is executed first any mappings from a secondary/target process are mapped into a primary process, and from there if there are any rules to trigger on the secondary/target process those are executed, but a rule will only execute when the previous rule has completed. This is different to asynchronous execution where the system will execute rules without waiting for the previous rule execution to finish. Within time defined rules, like <a href=/platform/rules/workflow/start-a-process/>Start a process</a> and <a href=/platform/rules/workflow/schedule-a-rule/>Schedule a rule</a> there is an option to choose between synchronous/in-series or asynchronous/in-parallel where the latter may be useful for rules without dependency.</p><p><img src=/images/execute-in-series.jpg alt="Execute in series option on rules"></p><h2 id=rule-order-example>Rule order example</h2><p>For example, you may want a process to send automated emails to a safety manager, where the email includes submitted form data. In this case a <strong>Send email rule</strong> could be attached to a form <strong>Submit</strong> button so an email is sent once the button is clicked. This will result in an automated email to a designated person. To generate a report of the completed form, you can use the <strong>Generate word</strong> <strong>document</strong> <strong>rule</strong> triggered again when the <strong>Submit</strong> button is clicked. In this example the <strong>Generate word document rule</strong> has to be executed <u>before</u> the <strong>Send email rule</strong>, so that the Word document can be generated and then attached to the email.</p><p>The rule order consideration is therefore particularly important when rules are <strong>dependent</strong> on each other - where the output of one rule is the input of another rule.</p><h2 id=changing-the-rule-order-of-multiple-rules>Changing the rule order of multiple rules</h2><p>In the example below we will look at changing the rule order of a Send email rule attached to a Submit button. The <strong>Submit</strong>, <strong>Save</strong> and <strong>Close</strong> buttons by default already have <strong>Submit</strong>, <strong>Save</strong> and <strong>Close</strong> process rules attached, in order to allow form shutdown.</p><p>To change rule order, when the rule is created:</p><ol>
<li>Click on the item that has multiple rules attached, for example a <strong>Submit</strong> button. Remember by default Submit buttons in forms will have &lsquo;form shutdown&rsquo; rules, namely <strong>Submit</strong>, <strong>Save</strong> and <strong>Close</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Rules</strong> in the right-hand pane, drag the <strong>Send email</strong> rule to the top of the list by clicking on the rule and drag it to the top of the list, before <strong>Submit</strong>, <strong>Save</strong> and <strong>Close</strong> rules.</li></ol><p><img src=https://academy.kianda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ruleorder_frame.png alt=img></p><p>The video below shows an example of a <strong>Send email rule</strong> being created and saved. The rule is attached to the <strong>Submit</strong> button. Once the rule is created, by default the new rule goes to the bottom of the list of rules. To move the rule, simply click on it and drag it to where you wish to place it. In this example we want the email sent <u>before</u> any of the shutdown processes like Submit or Save, but after a <strong>Generate Inspection</strong> rule, so the output from that rule can be used in the Send email rule.</p><video width=100% style=width:100% controls>

As a user with an <strong>administrator</strong> or <strong>designer</strong> role, you can use Kianda <strong>Designer</strong> to populate fields within the Kianda form, using the <strong>Edit rule</strong> dialog box to set parameters for success and error mapping.</p><h2 id=when-to-use>When to use</h2><p>Success and Error mapping should be with rule execution, displaying values that you want for rule execution success or failure.</p><p><strong>You can use mapping with the following rules:</strong></p><ul>
<li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> Data rules > Find items</li><li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> Data rules > Create item</li><li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> Data rules > Update item</li><li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> Data rules > Delete item</li><li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> All SharePoint rules, except Get attachments and Create anonymous link</li></ul><h2 id=how-to-use>How to use</h2><ol>
<li>
<p>Select the field that will have the rule attached, for example a button at the end of a form, or a field within a form.</p></li><li>
<p>Click on <strong>Add a rule</strong> in the left-hand pane and select one of the rules that uses mapping as shown in the <a href=#when-to-use>When to use</a> list above, for example the <strong>SharePoint rule</strong> called <strong>Create list</strong>, used to create a list in SharePoint dynamically using Kianda form data.</p><p><img src=/images/create-a-list-eg.jpg alt="(Example of a rule with mapping)"></p></li><li>
<p>In the <strong>Edit rule</strong> dialog box, give the rule a <strong>Title</strong>.</p></li><li>
<p>If you want to add conditions for the rule, click on the <strong>Edit conditions</strong> button <img src=/images/editconditions.png alt="Edit conditions button"> to create conditions for the rule, see <a href=/platform/rules/general/add-conditions/>Conditions</a> for more details.</p></li><li>
<p>Under <strong>Action</strong>, click on the field <strong>Select a SharePoint data source</strong> from the drop-down list.</p><p><img src=/images/create-a-list-filled.jpg alt="Create a list example with details"></p></li><li>
<p>Fill out any additional fields as necessary, for example to create a list the following fields must be completed:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>List template</strong> - choose from a list of SharePoint list types</p></li><li>
<p><strong>List name field</strong> - choose a form field that will be used the create a name for the list in SharePoint</p></li><li>
<p><strong>List url field</strong> - choose a form field that will be used in the creation of a URL within SharePoint</p></li><li>
<p><strong>List description field</strong> - choose a form field that describes what the list is about</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Quick Launch menu</strong> - options are <strong>Yes</strong> or <strong>No</strong>. Choosing <strong>Yes</strong> allows the created list to be displayed in the Quick Launch menu, containing a link to the list.</p></li></ul></li><li>
<p>To add success mapping, click on <strong>On success mapping</strong> and click on the <strong>Add mapping</strong> button. See <a href=/platform/rules/general/success-error-mapping/#on-success-mapping>On Success Mapping</a> for more details.</p></li><li>

<p>you simply need to select the field within the form which will store the error message</p></li><li>
<p>When you are finished editing the dialog box, click on <strong>OK</strong> or click on <strong>Close</strong> at any time to exit the dialog box.</p></li></ol><h3 id=on-success-mapping>On Success Mapping</h3><p>Success mapping is a concept of <strong>populating</strong> your form fields with <strong>data</strong> that is <strong>retrieved</strong> from a <strong>datasource</strong> using a <strong>data connector</strong>, to learn more about data connectors go to <a href=/platform/connectors/>Data connectors</a>. This retrieved data from the datasource is known as a <strong>response</strong>. Using this response data, you can populate a field within your form, for example you can retrieve a file which is stored in your SharePoint or Dropbox datasource and populate the retrieved file into a <strong>File field</strong>. This will give you the ability to access the retrieved file in your process.</p><p>All data connectors within Kianda may have different response data that can be used to populate fields in a form. You can use the <strong>Success mapping</strong> in the rules mentioned in the <a href=/platform/rules/general/success-error-mapping/#when-to-use>When to use</a> section. Take one of the SharePoint rules <a href=/platform/rules/sharepoint/create-a-site/><strong>Create a site</strong></a> as an example. When all information is filled out in the rule, in the <strong>On success mapping</strong> section you can assess the <strong>data object</strong> (response) called <strong>Site properties</strong>. From the <strong>Site properties</strong> data object you can access three different pieces of data; <strong>Site Name</strong>, <strong>Site Id</strong> and <strong>Site URL</strong>. You can map (populate) those piece of data into fields in your form by selecting a field in the <strong>Form field</strong> section:</p><p><img src=/images/success-mapping.jpg alt="Success mapping example"></p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Form field</strong> - this field allows you to select a field in your form to store the value from the datasource.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Data source field or text</strong> - this field allows you to select which piece of data your want to retrieve from the datasource, and store it in a form field.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Add mapping</strong> - Click on the <strong>Add mapping</strong> to add more fields for mapping results from the datasource to form fields.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Bin/Trash</strong> <strong><img src=/images/bin.png alt="Bin/Trash button"></strong> - Click on the <strong>Bin/Trash</strong> button <img src=/images/bin.png alt="Bin/Trash button"> to delete a mapping.</p></li></ul><h3 id=on-error-mapping>On Error Mapping</h3><p>Error mapping is a concept of populating a form field in your Kianda process when using the rules from the <a href=/platform/rules/general/success-error-mapping/#when-to-use>When to use</a> section. When using those rules, you get presented with the ability to map an <strong>error</strong> when there is an <strong>issue</strong> as the rule is executing, for example incorrectly filling out a parameter. It is useful to know the details of the error message that comes from the datasource your are connecting with. To see the error message, you need to create a <strong>separate <a href=/platform/controls/input/textbox/>Text box</a> field</strong> in your form and map the error to that field. Open the <strong>On error mapping</strong> section and add a mapping by clicking on <strong>Add mapping</strong> button:</p><p><img src=/images/error-mapping.jpg alt="Error mapping example"></p><ul>
<li>
<p>In the <strong>Form field</strong>, select a form field which will store the error message in your Kianda form.</p></li><li>
<p>In the <strong>Error message or text</strong> field, enter an error message that you want to appear in the event of errors or click on the text box and select the <strong>Error message</strong> option to use a system generated error indicating what has gone wrong when the rule executed.</p></li><li>
<p>Click on the <strong>Add mapping</strong> button to add further mappings.</p></li><li>

<h1 id=pg-1e5f6b5a91f063f4a6c7ae71d0d4677d>5.2 - Workflow rules</h1><p><strong>Workflow</strong> rules is one category of <a href=/platform/rules/>rules</a> that relates to user interactions with form components. Using Workflow rules will allow you to change the flow of information within a process. For example in a simple Training Process that is made up of three forms by default, the <strong>first form</strong> in a process is the <strong>current form</strong>.</p><p><img src=/images/3-form-example.jpg alt="Three form process example"></p><p>In the example above, the workflow for this process would be completion of the forms in this order: <strong>Training Request</strong> > <strong>Training Approval</strong> > <strong>Training Attendance</strong>, however using Workflow rules, you could use <strong>Go to form</strong> to force the <strong>Training Attendance</strong> form to be the current form after the Training Request form has been completed.</p><p>You could also use the <strong>Assign form</strong> rule to assign editing rights to particular users so they can edit forms. See more about Go to form and Assign form below.</p><p>Using rules in this way changes the flow of the process, and additional levels of security and user interaction can be added using <strong>Process security</strong> and <strong>Hide or disable</strong> see below.</p><h2 id=getting-started-with-workflow-rules>Getting started with Workflow rules</h2><p>If you have the role <strong>Administrator</strong> or <strong>Design business process</strong>, go to <strong>Administration</strong> in the left-hand side menu and then <strong>Designer</strong> and click on an existing process or create a new process. Then decide on a form or field to add the rule to by clicking on that item and click on <strong>Add a rule</strong>.</p><p>The <strong>Workflow</strong> rules are found in the left-hand pane when you click on <strong>Workflow</strong>.</p><p><img src=/images/workflow-rules.jpg alt="Workflow rules"></p><p>There are seven types of <strong>Workflow</strong> rules as follows:</p><ol>
<li>
<h3 id=hide-or-disable>Hide or disable</h3><p>This rule is used to hide, disable, <strong>show or enable one or more fields, one or more sections or entire forms</strong>. This rule has special meaning in terms of workflow allowing the application to direct user action and flow by hiding or showing entire sections of the application.</p></li><li>
<h3 id=make-required>Make required</h3><p>Use this rule to make individual <strong>fields required or entire forms</strong>. Unlike the field property &lsquo;Required&rsquo;, this rule will dynamically allocate a mandatory status on chosen forms or fields, that users must complete and submit.</p></li><li>
<h3 id=go-to-form>Go to form</h3><p><strong>Go to form</strong> rule <strong>navigates</strong> the user from the current form to the destination form. This rule could also set the destination form&rsquo;s display mode.</p></li><li>
<h3 id=assign-form>Assign form</h3><p>This rule <strong>enables dynamic form ownership</strong> and form security assignment of a form owner by assigning a user or a group to a form. You could also choose to override or append the form owner. By default only form owners can see the form in edit</p></li><li>
<h3 id=process-security>Process security</h3><p>This rule <strong>defines the security of the entire process instance</strong> (record). Using this rule, you could add any user or group with the right permissions to view/update any instances.</p></li><li>
<h3 id=start-a-sub-process>Start a (sub) process</h3><p><strong>Start a process</strong> rule helps you <strong>create a new instance of the same process or a different process</strong>. You could also map the inputs from the current instance to a new instance.</p></li><li>
<h3 id=schedule-a-rule>Schedule a rule</h3><p>This rule helps you <strong>schedule a rule/rules to be triggered</strong> one time, with a recurring schedule or immediately. For example, this rule could be used to schedule a daily reminder email to a user if the task is not complete.</p></li></ol><h3 id=whats-next--idea-iconimages18png>What&rsquo;s next <img src=/images/18.png alt="Idea icon"></h3><p>We have briefly introduced each of the six types of <strong>Workflow rules</strong>. Now let&rsquo;s look at each of these types of rules in more detail:</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always>
<h1 id=pg-08bfde79ec35c0b9665ffc6399d74374>5.2.1 - Show, hide or disable</h1><h2 id=introduction>Introduction</h2><p>Use the <strong>Hide or Disable</strong> rule to hide, disable, show or enable a field or a component in a Kianda form. This rule is very useful if you want different parts of a form, a complete form or multiple forms, to appear or hide based on how the form user completes the form.</p><p>There are seven possible actions within this rule that can be applied to fields or forms:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Hide</strong> from the user (not visible)</li><li><strong>Show</strong> to the user (visible)</li><li><strong>Disable</strong> for the user (not enabled)</li><li><strong>Enable</strong> for the user (enabled)</li><li><strong>Toggle visible:</strong> toggle between visible and not visible</li><li><strong>Toggle enable</strong>: toggle between enabled and not enabled</li><li><strong>Hide and clear</strong>: hide from the user (not visible) and clear the contents</li></ul><h2 id=when-to-use>When to use</h2><p>You can add this rule:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><input checked disabled type=checkbox> to a field</p></li><li>
<p><input checked disabled type=checkbox> to a form</p></li><li>
<p><input checked disabled type=checkbox> to a process (the rule will run on load)</p></li></ul><h2 id=how-to-get-started>How to get started</h2><p>The following steps illustrate a scenario to <strong>hide</strong> and <strong>show</strong> fields. The same steps can be applied to enable, disable, toggle enable and so on. To dynamically hide a field:</p><ol>
<li>
<p>If you have the role <strong>Administrator</strong> or <strong>Design business process</strong>, go to <strong>Administration</strong> > <strong>Designer</strong>, open an existing process or create a new process and decide which form or field you will apply the rule to, by clicking on that item so that it is in <strong>edit mode</strong> so you can see the Edit/pen button, <strong>Pen</strong> button <img src=/images/penicon.png alt="Pen button">.</p></li><li>
<p>Click on <strong>Add a rule</strong> > <strong>Workflow</strong> > <strong>Hide or Disable</strong>.</p></li><li>
<p>In the <strong>Edit rule - Hide or Disable</strong> dialog box, give the rule a title in the <strong>Title</strong> field.</p><p><img src=/images/hide-or-disable.jpg alt="Edit rule - Hide or Disable dialog box"></p></li><li>
<p>If you want to add conditions for the rule, click on the <strong>Edit conditions</strong> button <img src=/images/editconditions.png alt="Edit conditions button"> to create conditions for the rule, see <a href=/platform/rules/general/add-conditions/>Conditions</a> for more details.</p></li><li>
<p>Under <strong>Action</strong> create one or more actions for the rule by clicking on the <strong>empty field</strong> to add a form or form field, and then choose an option from the action drop-down list, choosing from <strong>Hide</strong>, <strong>Show</strong>, <strong>Disable</strong>, <strong>Enable</strong>, <strong>Toggle visible</strong>, <strong>Toggle enable</strong>, or <strong>Hide and clear</strong>, see <a href=#introduction>Introduction</a> for an explanation of each action.</p><p><img src=/images/hide-example.jpg alt="Hide or disable example - Hide or show"></p><p>For example in the image above, a <strong>Feedback</strong> field will be hidden, using <strong>Hide</strong>, based on a condition, when a field <strong>Management decision</strong> equals a value <strong>&lsquo;Yes&rsquo;</strong>.</p></li><li>
<p>To add more actions, click on <strong>Add</strong>. At any time remove an action by clicking on the <strong>Bin/Trash</strong> icon <img src=/images/bin.png alt="Bin/Trash button"> beside the name of the action.</p></li><li>
<p>Just like an &lsquo;if..else&rsquo; statement, you can add alternative/elsewise actions, based on different conditions by clicking on <strong>Add otherwise action</strong>.</p><p><img src=/images/hide-or-show-example.jpg alt="Hide or show example"></p><p>In the example above, <strong>Signature</strong> and <strong>Training materials</strong> field will show and a <strong>Feedback</strong> field will hide, while a <strong>Management decision</strong> field has a value of <strong>Yes</strong>, otherwise the shown fields will hide, while the <strong>Feedback</strong> field shows <strong>No</strong>. The result is a dynamic form that will reveal particular fields based on user input for the Management decision field.</p></li><li>
<p>To remove the otherwise action(s), click on the <strong>Remove otherwise action</strong> fields.</p></li><li>
<p>When you are finished editing the dialog box, click on <strong>OK</strong> or click on <strong>Close</strong> at any time to exit the dialog box.</p></li><li>
<p>If the rule is attached to a field within a form, a rule notification will appear within the form design, for example a rule is applied to the field <strong>Management decision</strong> as shown in the image below.</p><p><img src=/images/rule-in-form-example.jpg alt="Rule on a form field"></p></li><li>
<p>When you click on the field or form that has the rule attached, the rule will appear in the right-hand pane under <strong>Rules</strong>.</p><p><img src=/images/hide-or-show-rule.jpg alt="Hide or disable rule example"></p><p>The next section will cover how to use the buttons visible in the right-hand pane to manipulate the rule.</p></li></ol><h3 id=editing-deleting-or-duplicating-rules>Editing, deleting or duplicating rules</h3><p>When you have clicked on an existing rule, and the rule is visible in the right-hand pane under <strong>Rules</strong>, there are a number of options available to you.</p><ol>

However using this rule gives a greater degree of flexibility to cause an action based on user input using a <a href=/platform/rules/general/add-conditions/><strong>Condition</strong></a>.</p><p>Take the example of a feedback form, where there is an option for a customer to fill in their name or not. If they do fill in their name however, then a Customer Account Number field becomes mandatory.</p><p><img src=/images/make-required-example.jpg alt="Make required rule example"></p><p>As soon as Maddie fills out her name in the example above, then and only then the Customer Account Number becomes required, indicated by an asterix. This rule could be combined with <a href=/platform/rules/workflow/hide-or-disable/>Hide or Disable</a> rule to make fields appear/hidden based on user input.</p><h2 id=when-to-use>When to use</h2><p>You can add this rule:</p><ul>

This means that when a process instance is created, a form owner can <strong>edit</strong> the form in the process instance, for example a manager who needs to add comments on an appraisal form that has been submitted by an employee.</p><p>You can use this rule to override the existing form owners, or to add users or groups to the list of existing form owners. When assigning forms you can choose from:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Any user</strong> - choose from any user, groups or partners defined in the system</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Current user</strong> - make the current form user, the form owner</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Defined in a user field</strong> - use a selected user/group/partner chosen in a user picker field</p></li><li>

<p>Click on the <strong>Add table mapping</strong> button to add more tables.</p></li></ol><h3 id=on-success-mapping>On success mapping</h3><p>If you wish to <strong>update an existing process instance</strong> you can use mapping within the <strong>On success mapping</strong> section to retrieve the <strong>Process ID</strong> of that process instance, and then trigger rules in the target process instance. A <strong>text box</strong> field within the form can be created to hold the Process ID value, see <a href=#before-getting-started>Before getting started</a>. The ID for the existing process instance, is one of the <a href=/platform/application-designer/process/common-fields/>Common fields</a> that can be pulled from the system.</p><p>To use On success mapping:</p><ol>
<li>
<p>Click on the green bar of <strong>On success mapping</strong> to reveal primary and secondary/target process form fields. For example in the image below, the primary process is called <strong>Onboarding HR</strong> and the secondary process is called <strong>Send email process</strong>. Both of these appear automatically below when the green bar is clicked on.</p><ul>
<li>From here you can choose to add in form fields, for example a text box field called <strong>Sales Onboarding Process ID</strong> that will hold a common field <strong>Process ID</strong> from the target process.</li></ul><p><img src=/images/success-mapping-start-rule.jpg alt="On success mapping options"></p><ul>
<li>Click on the <strong>Bin/Trash</strong> button <img src=/images/binicon.png alt="Bin button"> to delete a mapping.</li><li>Click on the <strong>Add mapping</strong> button <img src=/images/add-mapping-button.jpg alt="Add mapping button"> to add further mappings from the secondary/target process to the primary process. Ensure that form fields are already precreated to hold these values.</li></ul></li><li>
<p>Further options exist under this section, starting with <strong>Trigger rules in target instance</strong> allowing you to kick off business rules enabling actions in the target process. Options are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>No</strong> where triggering rules is disabled, and no further options appear.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Yes</strong> where triggering rules is enabled, and further options appear:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Select a field or rule to trigger on target process</strong> - clicking on this field allows you to choose a <strong>form</strong> from the target process and from there you can drill down to a <strong>field</strong> to trigger <strong>all the rules</strong> attached to that field, or drill down to a particular <strong>rule</strong> so that only that rule will be triggered as shown in the example below.</p><p><img src=/images/trigger-rule-target-process.jpg alt="Trigger rule target process"></p><p>If you want to <strong>save values passed</strong> under <a href=#input-mapping>Input mapping</a> then trigger the <strong>Save</strong> button (that contains the <strong>Save process</strong> and <strong>Close</strong> rules) found by default in all Kianda forms.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Enable real-time rule execution</strong>? - options are <strong>Yes</strong> or <strong>No</strong>. If you choose <strong>Yes</strong>, rules in the secondary/target process instance will trigger without any delay in the server. If you choose <strong>No</strong> then a second option becomes available to allow you to choose to <strong>Execute in series?</strong></p><p><img src=/images/rule-execution-options.jpg alt="Rule execution options"></p><ul>
<li><strong>Execute in series</strong>? - options are <strong>Yes</strong> or <strong>No</strong>. If you choose <strong>No</strong> then the server side execution of rules will happen in series or in sequence, instead of in parallel. In series or in sequence refers to synchronous execution, where a rule will only execute when the previous rule has completed. In parallel refers to asynchronous execution whereby rules execute without waiting for the previous rule to finish. This type of execution is useful when rules are not dependent on each other, for example the output of one rule is not used as input for another.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>

If a form field has <strong>multiple</strong> rules attached to it, that include the <strong>Schedule a rule</strong> rule, rules can execute sequentially and you can change the order of the rule execution, see <a href=/platform/rules/general/multiple-rules/>Multiple rules</a> for details. You can also select a specific rule to execute. For example in the image below, the text box field <strong>First Name</strong> is expanded to show two rules. You can select all or just one rule to be triggered. You can select all rules by selecting the <strong>First Name</strong> text box itself or to select just one rule you can expand the field and selecting the desired rule you want to schedule:</p><p><img src=/images/schedule-rule-single-rule.jpg alt="Selecting one rule to be triggered"></p><h2 id=when-to-use>When to use</h2><p>You can add this rule:</p><ul>
<li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> to a field</li><li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> to a form</li><li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> to a process (the rule will run on load)</li></ul><h2 id=how-to-get-started>How to get started</h2><p>The following step illustrates a scenario to schedule a reminder email using the <a href=/platform/rules/communications/send-email/>Send email rule</a> when a form is submitted:</p><ol>
<li>
<p>Click on an existing process by going to <strong>Administration</strong> > <strong>Designer</strong> and decide which form, or field you will apply the rule to, by clicking on that item so that it is in <strong>edit mode</strong> so you can see the Edit/pen button, <strong>Pen</strong> button <img src=/images/penicon.png alt="Pen button">.</p></li><li>
<p>Click on <strong>Add a rule</strong> > <strong>Workflow</strong> > <strong>Schedule a rule</strong>.</p></li><li>
<p>In the <strong>Edit rule - Schedule a rule</strong> dialog box, give the rule a title in the <strong>Title</strong> field.</p><p><img src=/images/schedule-rule-details.jpg alt="Go to form rule"></p></li><li>
<p>If you want to add conditions for the rule, click on the <strong>Edit conditions</strong> button <img src=/images/editconditions.png alt="Edit conditions button"> to create conditions for the rule, see <a href=/platform/rules/general/add-conditions/>Conditions</a> for more details.</p></li><li>
<p>Under <strong>Action</strong> fill out the following:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Select the field or rule to trigger on schedule</strong> - allows you to select a field or rule you want to trigger. If a field has multiple rules, they will be triggered sequentially and you can change the order of the rule execution, see <a href=/platform/rules/general/multiple-rules/>Multiple rules</a> for details. You can also select a specific rule from a field with multiple rules by drilling down and selecting the desired rule. In this example we want to select a rule called <strong>Send email</strong> which is attached to the <strong>Submit</strong> button.</p><p><img src=/images/schedule-rule-send-email.jpg alt="Schedule a send email rule"></p></li><li>
<p><strong>Schedule</strong> - allows you to choose a time of schedule. For this example we will select to send the email <strong>Weekly</strong> at 10 am every 2 weeks.</p><p><img src=/images/schedule-rule-weekly.jpg alt="Schedule a send email rule"></p><p>You can select a different type of schedule that is suited to your rule, here are the options:</p><ul>
<li><strong>One time</strong> - Select <strong>Time mode</strong> as <strong>Absolute</strong> or <strong>Relative</strong> from now. If <strong>Absolute</strong>, you can select the time using the clock icon and the date using the calendar icon or you can select a form field (where the date is stored) by clicking on the icon with black discs <img src=/images/icon-blackdisks.jpg alt=Disks>. If <strong>Relative</strong> from now, enter the days, hours and minutes directly.</li><li><strong>Minutes</strong> - select the number of minutes you want the scheduled rule to reoccur.</li><li><strong>Hourly</strong> - select the number of minutes and hours you want the scheduled rule to reoccur.</li><li><strong>Daily</strong> - select the time of day and the number of days you want the scheduled rule to reoccur. You can select that the rule will trigger only on week days by enabling the <strong>Week days only</strong> checkbox.</li><li><strong>Weekly</strong> - select a day of the week, time of the day and the number of weeks that you want the scheduled rule to reoccur.</li><li><strong>Monthly</strong> - select the date of the month or <strong>First, Second, Third, Fourth, Last</strong> weekday of the month. You can also select a specific time that you want the scheduled rule to reoccur.</li><li><strong>Immediately</strong> - the rule will trigger immediately.</li></ul></li><li>
<p><strong>Expire</strong> - It is possible to set the schedule rule to expire by enabling <strong>Expire</strong> checkbox. For this example we will use the <strong>When</strong> option and apply a condition. The goal of the reminder is to send it every two weeks until the status of the process is completed. In the <strong>condition</strong> of the <strong>When</strong> option, select <strong>Status</strong> from the <a href=/platform/application-designer/process/common-fields/>Common fields</a> and make it <strong>equals</strong> to <strong>completed</strong> as shown in the image below:</p><p><img src=/images/schedule-rule-status.jpg alt="Schedule a send email rule"></p><p>There are three options when to expire the scheduled rule:</p><ul>
<li><strong>By</strong> - the rule will expire by the date and time given. Either select the time using the clock icon and the date using the calendar icon OR select a form field (where the date is stored) by clicking on the icon with black discs.</li><li><strong>After</strong> - the rule will expire after a set number of occurrences. Select the number of occurrences in the blank field or click on the icon with black discs to choose a field where the number of occurrences is stored.</li><li><strong>When</strong> - add a condition which will cause the rule to expire when it is true.</li></ul></li></ul><p>You are also presented with <strong>two more options</strong> when selecting any of the <strong>Schedule</strong> options except <strong>Immediately</strong>, the options are:</p><p><img src=/images/schedule-rule-extra-options.jpg alt="Extra options for the schedule a rule"></p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Make task unique</strong> - enable this option to prevent a second identical task being created for this instance of the process</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Execute in series</strong> - select <strong>Yes</strong> if you want the server-side execution to be in series rather than in parallel.</p></li></ul></li><li>

<h1 id=pg-4dd5882378c8be3d2725ebaa488de80f>5.3 - Communication rules</h1><h2 id=introduction>Introduction</h2><p><strong>Communication</strong> rules is one category of <a href=/platform/rules/>rules</a> to enable automated communications with process users, for example sending meeting requests or even user push notifications.</p><p>Take an example of a <strong>User alert</strong> rule. Implementing this rule will result in a new item in the <strong>user notification</strong> in the <a href=/platform/general/quickaction/><strong>Quick action menu</strong></a>, for example a rule that alerts a user to complete a form. The user notification icon will look like this when the alert comes in, indicating there is one new notification: <img src=/images/user-notification-new-item.jpg alt="New user notification"></p><p>Clicking on the notification icon, opens up a pop-up box with the notification, for example:</p><p><img src=/images/user-alert-example.jpg alt="User alert example to complete a form"></p><p>Clicking on the Reminder itself will bring the user to that form within the process instance, for the user to complete.</p><p>Depending on how you configure the alert, you can create an alert message which appears as a warning in a user&rsquo;s workspace as shown in the image below.</p><p><img src=/images/user-alert-warning2.jpg alt="user alert warning"></p><h2 id=getting-started-with-communication-rules>Getting started with Communication rules</h2><p>If you go to <strong>Administration</strong> > <strong>Designer</strong> and click on a process or create a new process, then click on <strong>Add a rule</strong> the <strong>Communication</strong> rules are found in the left-hand pane when you click on <strong>Communications</strong>.</p><p><img src=/images/communication-rules-all.jpg alt="Communication rules"></p><p>There are four types of <strong>Communication</strong> rules as follows:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Send email</strong> - This rule allows you to send automated emails that contain images, text, process and other links and attachments. Email templates are defined within the rule, allowing you to style emails the way you want and use <a href=/platform/rules/general/expression-builder/>Expressions</a> to automate the process. You can map fields and content from within the process, for example using a userpicker field so that user input in a form determines who an email is sent to. Emails can be sent out using a predefined SMTP connector, see <a href=/platform/connectors/email/#setting-up-a-global-smtp-mail-connector>Setting up a Global SMTP mail Connector</a> for more details.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Meeting request</strong> - This rule is similar to the <strong>Send email</strong> rule and allows you to send automated specially formatted emails that contain a meeting request.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Anonymous form link</strong> - This rule creates an anonymous link to a form which can be sent to external users who do not need Kianda login details or accounts to access the form(s), for example contractors or third party providers. The receivers of the link can then simply click on the link and submit data back to a process instance in Kianda.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>User alert</strong> - This rule sends an alert to a user which appears in the user notifications in the top right-hand quick actions menu bar. See <a href=/platform/general/quickaction/>Quick action menu</a> for an introduction to the shortcuts available to users including notifications. You can configure the alert to appear the way you want for example to allow warning messages to appear as shown in the image in the <a href=#introduction>Introduction</a> or to link to a form for a user to complete.</p></li></ul><h3 id=whats-next--idea-iconimages18png>What&rsquo;s next <img src=/images/18.png alt="Idea icon"></h3><p>To read more about each of the rule types go to the links below:</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always>
<h1 id=pg-61ceffe8d0f6d01c9afca224c4cc3aaf>5.3.1 - Send email</h1><p>This rule sends an email according to a predefined template. Each element of the email is configurable. The body of the email can include text, images and attachments. Data stored in fields in the current form can be copied in dynamically.</p><h2 id=when-to-use-the-send-email-rule>When to use the Send email rule</h2><p>You can add this rule:</p><ul>
<li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> to a field</li><li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> to a form</li><li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> to a process (the rule will run on load)</li></ul><h2 id=before-you-get-started>Before you get started</h2><p>In advance of using this rule, you need to have <strong>created one or more forms, complete with control fields</strong>. For example a text box control with an employee&rsquo;s &lsquo;Name&rsquo; may be part of a form &lsquo;Annual Leave Request&rsquo;. Then this &lsquo;Name&rsquo; field can be used as an <strong>expression</strong> in the email to send personalised emails, so these aspects must be set up in advance.</p><ol>
<li>Decide how the rule will be implemented, for example will an email be sent once a form is saved or submitted. In the example of form submit, then click on that form in the process > <strong>Submit</strong> button > <strong>Add a rule</strong> > <strong>Send email</strong>.</li><li>Decide who the automated email will be sent from, for example a no-reply type email. If you leave the From field empty, the email will be sent from <a href=mailto:noreply@kianda.com>noreply@kianda.com</a>. If you want your email to come from a different sender, then go to <a href=/platform/rules/communications/send-email/#email-connector>Email connector</a> for more details on how to set that up.</li><li>Any email addresses to send To, From, CC or BCC must be set up in advance. This could be a textbox in a form called &lsquo;Email address&rsquo; with a unique Name like &rsquo;emailAddress&rsquo;, or it could be a user picker field associated with particular users, groups or partners.</li><li>If you want to track the emails, then you must set up a field in your form to store email tracking.</li><li>If you want to attach any files to an email, files must first be stored in a File field in one of the forms.</li></ol><h2 id=how-to-get-started>How to get started</h2><ol>

It works exactly like the <a href=/platform/rules/communications/send-email/>Send email</a> rule with three additional fields to which are used to set up the date and time of the meeting. The three additional fields are as follow:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Start time</strong> - indicating the starting date and time of the meeting.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>End time</strong> - indicating the ending date and time of the meeting.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Location</strong> - indicating the location of the meeting.</p><p><img src=/images/meeting-request-fields.jpg alt></p></li></ul><p>If you are using an email connector, a meeting request will appear in the calendar of the receiver(s). Otherwise the meeting request will appear as a calendar file (.ics file type) attached to an email. to learn more about email connector go to <a href=/platform/connectors/email/>Email connector</a>.</p><h2 id=when-to-use>When to use</h2><p>You can add this rule:</p><ul>
<li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> to a field</li><li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> to a form</li><li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> to a process (the rule will run on load)</li></ul><h2 id=before-you-get-started>Before you get started</h2><p>In advance of using this rule, you need to have <strong>created one or more forms, complete with control fields</strong>. For example a <a href=/platform/controls/input/textbox/>Text box control</a> with an employee’s ‘Name’ may be part of a form ‘Meeting request’. Then this ‘Name’ field can be used as an <strong>expression</strong> in the email to send personalised emails, so these aspects must be set up in advance. The Meeting request rule must also contain three specific fields which are the <a href=/platform/controls/input/date/>Date control</a> for both the <strong>Start</strong> and <strong>End</strong> time fields, as well as textbox control or a <a href=/platform/controls/input/list/>List control</a> a field for the <strong>Location</strong>.</p><ol>
<li>Decide how the rule will be implemented, for example will an email be sent once a form is saved or submitted. In the example of form submit, then click on that form in the process > <strong>Submit</strong> button > <strong>Add a rule</strong> > <strong>Send email</strong>.</li><li>Decide who the automated email will be sent from, for example a no-reply type email. If you leave the From field empty, the email will be sent from <a href=mailto:noreply@kianda.com>noreply@kianda.com</a>. If you want your email to come from a different sender, then go to <a href=http://localhost:1313/platform/rules/communications/send-email/#email-connector>Email connector</a> for more details on how to set that up.</li><li>Any email addresses to send To, From, CC or BCC must be set up in advance. This could be a textbox in a form called ‘Email address’ with a unique Name like ’emailAddress’, or it could be a user picker field associated with particular users, groups or partners.</li><li>If you want to track the emails, then you must set up a field in your form to store email tracking.</li><li>If you want to attach any files to an email, files must first be stored in a File field in one of the forms.</li></ol><blockquote>
<p>Note; the start and end time fields are both required on the request meeting rule therefore you should make the start and end fields required on your form too.

<h1 id=pg-0f1503a6ad1c79fd81325b68ad26e1d6>5.4 - Data rules</h1><p><strong>Data</strong> rules is the category of rules that enables the flow of data between data connectors and form elements, for example reading or writing data from a database table or performing data manipulation.</p><p><img src=/images/data-rules-all.jpg alt="Data rules"></p><p>Take an example of one of the rules in the Data rules category, the <strong>Find items</strong> rule. This rule can be used to extract data from a data source and use this information in a Kianda form. Take an example of an Employee Onboarding or New hire process, where a user chooses a country for a &lsquo;Country&rsquo; field from a drop-down list.</p><p><img src=/images/find-items-example.jpg alt="Drop-down list Find items example"></p><p>The drop-down list is populated using a SharePoint list in this example, and the &lsquo;Country&rsquo; field in turn uses a <strong>Find item</strong> rule to populate the table below it in the form.</p><p><img src=/images/find-items-populate.jpg alt="Find items rule populating a table"></p><p>The section below introduces each of the Data rules.</p><h2 id=getting-started-with-data-rules>Getting started with Data rules</h2><p>If you go to <strong>Administration</strong> > <strong>Designer</strong> and click on a process or create a new process, then click on <strong>Add a rule</strong> the <strong>Data</strong> rules are found in the left-hand pane when you click on <strong>Data</strong>.</p><p>There are five types of <strong>Data</strong> rules as follows:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Create item</strong> - The create item rule is used to create an item on your data connection. This is a straightforward rule which allows you to connect to your data source and map inputs. You can also map a data source field or text back to Kianda on success or store an error message on failure.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Delete item</strong> - To delete an item from your data connection, you could use a data source filter and map data source field or text from a data connection to Kianda form field.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Update item</strong> - This rule works in the same way as the Delete item rule. At any point, if you would like to update any item on your data connection, use this rule. To find an item to update, you could use a data source filter and map the input fields or text.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Find items</strong> - Use this rule together with a datasource to perform a query and return data for use with the form. To find an item, you could use a data source filter which acts as a conditional bridge between Kianda and data-connections. If the condition is true, you could map the data source field or text to the Kianda form field.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Set form field</strong> - This rule is used to update the value of fields in a form. The field value could be simple text or based on a custom expression with the ability to define JavaScript expressions. Use this rule to copy content between fields or to apply a custom expression to set the value of a given field.</p></li></ul><h3 id=whats-next--idea-iconimages18png>What&rsquo;s next <img src=/images/18.png alt="Idea icon"></h3><p>We have briefly introduced each of the five types of <strong>Data rules</strong>.

<h1 id=pg-de4bdabf10262e3207fc78806630e2a0>5.5 - User rules</h1><h2 id=introduction>Introduction</h2><p><strong>User rules</strong> is one of the category of <a href=/platform/rules/>rules</a> available in Kianda, that enables user-based operations associated with user <strong>properties</strong>, for example <strong>updating</strong> a user property, <strong>retrieving</strong> a user property and <strong>finding</strong> a user based on a property. The user rules also allow you to <strong>invite partners</strong> and <strong>share</strong> a particular process with them. These rules are very useful when you want to do any property actions on a user like find a user or update a property of a specific user.</p><p>Take an example of a <strong>Look up user by property</strong> rule. Implementing this rule will allow you to store a user in a <strong>User picker</strong> field by providing a property of a user, for example user role or email address. See image below when a location is being chosen, a trainer is found that is assigned to the location:</p><p><img src=/images/lookup-user-location.jpg alt="User rules"></p><p>In this example the <strong>Location of training</strong> is a <strong>List</strong> control is connected to a <strong>SQL Server connector</strong>. The Display field, Value field and Sort by of the List control is set to <strong>Location</strong>. With the list control set up that way, we are provided with a list based on our Location column in the database. For more information on how to create a List control and set its datasource go to <a href=/platform/controls/input/list/>List control</a>. See image below to see how the <strong>Location of training</strong> field is set up:</p><p><img src=/images/users-list-control-example.jpg alt="User rules"></p><p>With all of our users, we have set up a <strong>Location property</strong> and each user is assigned a different locations based on where they operate and provide training. The <strong>lookup user by property</strong> is set to <strong>Location</strong> which we provide to the rule by selecting our <strong>Location of training</strong> field. The outcome of this combination will set our <strong>Trainer</strong> field with the user that the <strong>Location property</strong> matches the value specified in the <strong>Location of training</strong> field. To learn more about how to create your own user properties and attributes go to <a href=/platform/administration/users/#modify-profile-attributes>Modifying profile attributes</a>. See image below of the Lookup user by property rule:</p><p><img src=/images/users-lookup.jpg alt="User rules"></p><p>For example when a user selects <strong>Galway</strong> from the <strong>Location of training</strong>, the lookup rule will search for a user that has the location property set to Galway and the result is <strong>Mark Lycette</strong>.

<h1 id=pg-644f257727736f5e222c9441240ef24a>5.6 - File management rules</h1><p><strong>File management</strong> rules is one category of <a href=/platform/rules/>rules</a> to enable operations such as the generation of Word documents, conversion to PDF format and merging PDF files together. These operations are useful when creating Word/Excel where the structure of those documents is the same for every instance but values are different. You can also use the <strong>File management</strong> rules for creating anonymous links which give access to files without permissions.</p><p>Take an example of a <strong>Create a file anonymous link</strong> rule. Implementing this rule will result in a <strong>randomly generated link</strong> which will lead to a file that you want to share. This link can be opened in <strong>any browser</strong> and can be <strong>accessible</strong> by anyone and there is <strong>no need for authentication</strong> when opening the link. You can also set the expiry time of the created link which will cause the link not to exist after the specified time. See images below for an example of the <strong>Create a file anonymous link</strong> rule:</p><p><img src=/images/file-managemt-rules-example.jpg alt="File management rules"></p><h2 id=getting-started-with-file-management-rules>Getting started with File management rules</h2><p>If you go to <strong>Administration</strong> > <strong>Designer</strong> and click on a process or create a new process, then click on <strong>Add a rule</strong> the <strong>File management</strong> rules are found in the left-hand pane when you click on <strong>File management</strong>.</p><p><img src=/images/file-managemt-rules.jpg alt="File management rules"></p><p>There are seven types of <strong>File management</strong> rules as follows:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Copy file</strong> - allows copying files between datasources. Use this file together with two file fields to move files between two different file locations. For example to copy files between an on premises folder and a SharePoint folder.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Convert to PDF</strong> - this rule allows the conversation of DOCX and DOC files into PDF format.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Generate word document</strong> - this rule generates a Word document from data associated with a process instance using a user-designed template.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Generate excel document</strong> - this rule generates an Excel workbook from data associated with a process instance using a user-designed template.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Set existing file</strong> - this rule is used to make an existing file accessible by a link, available within a configured file field. For example when you have access to a file through a link, you can use this link to store the file in a file field within your process.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Merge PDF</strong> - this rule allows you to merge two or more PDF files into a single PDF file. It also allows you to merge image file such as PNG or JPG to an existing PDF file.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Create a file anonymous link</strong> - this rule generates file links that can be shared anonymously with external users.

The Excel <strong>template</strong> needs to be <strong>pre-created</strong> before using this rule and must be <strong>attached to a file field</strong>, this way the rule will know which template you want to use when creating the workbook.</p><h2 id=when-to-use>When to use</h2><p>Use this rule when your process requires <strong>dynamic workbook generation</strong> where the structure of those workbooks is the same for every instance, but the values of fields are different. Use this rule with combination of the <strong>Table</strong> control to output big tables and transfer them into the Excel workbook, to learn more about table control go to <a href=/platform/controls/input/table/>Table control</a>. This rule will use an <strong>Excel template</strong> previously mapped with <strong>smart tags</strong>. Smart tags are created in Excel when a field is selected using the Kianda add-in task pane, and then inserted into the document, see image below for more details.</p><p><img src=/images/excel-add-in-smart-tag.jpg alt="Smart tag explanation"></p><p>You can add this rule:</p><ul>

Using this rule automates and speeds up the process of populating a table when a lot of data is present. CSV files may look different depending on what program you will open it with, here is an example of a CSV file opened with <strong>Excel</strong>:</p><p><img src=/images/csv-file-excel.jpg alt="CSV file - excel"></p><p>Here is the same file opened using <strong>Notepad</strong>:</p><p><img src=/images/csv-file-notepad.jpg alt="CSV file - notepad"></p><p>As shown in the two images above, the format changes depending on what <strong>program</strong> you <strong>open</strong> the file with. Using the <strong>Notepad</strong>, each column is <strong>separated</strong> with a <strong>comma</strong> and <strong>each new line is a row</strong>. <strong>Excel</strong> formats commas and new lines automatically and creates <strong>numbers for rows</strong> and <strong>letters for columns</strong>. The CSV file can be separated using <strong>different separators</strong> other than comma. For example you can use <code>;</code> as a separator, keep in mind that <strong>Excel</strong> does <strong>not format non-comma separated values correctly</strong> and the file will look as follows when opened using <strong>Excel</strong>:</p><p><img src=/images/import-csv-semicolon.jpg alt="CSV file - excel"></p><p>Here is the same file opened using <strong>Notepad</strong>:</p><p><img src=/images/csv-file-notepad-semicolon.jpg alt="CSV file - excel"></p><h2 id=when-to-use>When to use</h2><p>You can use this rule to populate a table when there is a lot of data present in a CSV file.

Using a file control, you can upload a csv file and use that csv file to populate a table. For more detail on how to add a file go to <a href=/platform/controls/input/file-upload/>File upload control</a>.</li></ul><p>Keep in mind that in order to populate a table within your process correctly, you need to have the <strong>same amount of columns</strong> in the table as inside of the CSV file. For example a table looking as follows:</p><p><img src=/images/import-csv-table.jpg alt="Import CSV rule - Sample table"></p><p>This indicates that the CSV file that we want to import should have three columns:</p><p><img src=/images/import-csv-file.jpg alt="CSV file"></p><h2 id=how-to-get-started>How to get started</h2><ol>

<p><strong>CSV separator</strong> - the default separator is a comma ( <strong>,</strong> ) but you can set it to any character, number or symbol you want. Keep in mind that the separator fields separates each column of a row. For example you can have a file that looks as follows:</p><p><em>This image represents how a table looks like applying the Import CSV rule with a sample file and when the CSV separator is set to a comma ( <strong>,</strong> ) see below:</em></p><p><img src=/images/import-csv-comma.jpg alt="Comma separated CSV file"></p></li><li>

Date rules can be utilised to set the time of a scheduled task, determine which process user submitted an instance first, and format dates that are inputted in date fields. To learn more about dates, see <a href=/platform/controls/input/date/>Date control</a>.</p><p>Below is an example of a date rule in operation; a <strong>Compare date</strong> rule is applied to a date field input in a form. If the date entered is after a set deadline, the field <strong>Status - After Deadline?</strong> in this process is set to Yes. You could use this to ensure that process instances must be completed before an upcoming deadline.</p><p><img src=/images/date-rules-compare-date-screen.jpg alt="Date rules"></p><h2 id=getting-started-with-date-rules>Getting started with Date rules</h2><p>If you go to <strong>Administration</strong> > <strong>Designer</strong> and click on a process or create a new process, then click on <strong>Add a rule</strong>, the <strong>Date</strong> rules are found in the left-hand pane when you click on <strong>Dates</strong>.</p><p><img src=/images/date-rules-all.jpg alt="Date rules"></p><p>There are four types of <strong>Date</strong> rules as follows:</p><ul>

This can used in conjunction with the <a href=/platform/rules/workflow/schedule-a-rule/>Schedule a rule</a> rule to schedule reminders for certain process instances.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Calculate time</strong> - this rule calculates the number of time units between two dates, or between now/today and a given date.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Compare dates</strong> - this rule allows the comparison of date fields to know if one date is for example, between dates, before or after a given date. The rule could be used to ensure that process instances must be completed before an upcoming deadline.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Format date</strong> - this rule applies custom formatting to input date fields so you can choose the format of the date (for example, parsing the date format MM/DD/YY to DD/MM/YY).</p></li></ul><h3 id=whats-next--idea-iconimages18png>What&rsquo;s next <img src=/images/18.png alt="Idea icon"></h3><p>We have briefly introduced the four types of Date rules.

<h1 id=pg-7f1377d36aa0eebe91af1cfa59a9b276>5.8.4 - Format date</h1><h2 id=introduction>Introduction</h2><p>The <strong>Format date</strong> rule is used to reformat a selected date field within your Kianda form, and send it to a destination field. You can choose from a range of date formats where month or day leads, and time is also included, see step 5 in <a href=#how-to-get-started>How to get started</a>.</p><p>In the below example, the Format date rule is applied to a selected field from the drop-down list and is formatted to the <em>MM/DD/YYYY</em> format. The resulting formatted date is then displayed in the <strong>Formatted Date</strong> field that is selected under <strong>Select a destination field for the formatted date</strong>. You can utilise this rule to format the entered date so that it matches various national date formatting standards. The default formatting for Kianda dates are <em>DD/MM/YYYY</em>, so in the below example an entered date of <em>23/08/2022</em> would become <em>08/23/2022</em>.</p><p><img src=/images/date-rules-format-date-screen.jpg alt="Format date screen"></p><h2 id=when-to-use>When to use</h2><p>The format date rule should be used when you wish to amend the formatting of a date field within Kianda.

These rules are using SharePoint Application Programming Interface (<strong>API</strong>) to perform Create, Read, Update and Delete (<strong>CRUD</strong>) operations within your SharePoint connector. The SharePoint rules are designed to <strong>manage</strong> your SharePoint connector instead of populating it with data. With these rules you can create a site, a list or a group on your SharePoint connector along with adding users to groups, removing them from groups or changing user or group permissions.</p><p>Take an example of a <strong>Find a user</strong> rule. Implementing this rule will result in acquiring a <strong>Username</strong> or <strong>User Id</strong> of a particular user which is part of your SharePoint users group. When using SharePoint rules that are managing users, the <strong>Find a user</strong> rule is very useful as rules such as <strong>Add user to a group</strong> or <strong>remove user from a group</strong> require a <strong>User Id</strong> that can be retrieved from the <strong>Find a user</strong> rule.</p><h2 id=before-getting-started>Before getting started</h2><p>In advance of using the SharePoint rules you must have created a SharePoint data connector and establish a connection with your SharePoint site. The data connector is used as part of the SharePoint rules to perform CRUD operations on a site you established a connection with. To learn more about the SharePoint data connector go to <a href=/platform/connectors/sharepoint/>SharePoint connector</a>.</p><h2 id=getting-started-with-sharepoint-rules>Getting started with SharePoint rules</h2><p>If you go to <strong>Administration</strong> > <strong>Designer</strong> and click on a process or create a new process, then click on <strong>Add a rule</strong>, the <strong>SharePoint</strong> rules are found in the left-hand pane when you click on <strong>SharePoint</strong>.</p><p><img src=/images/sharepoint-rules-all.jpg alt="Sharepoint rules"></p><p>There are 10 <strong>SharePoint</strong> rules as follows:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Create a list</strong> - creates a new list in a SharePoint site.</li><li><strong>Create a site</strong> - creates a new site on SharePoint, enabling the use of a site template.</li><li><strong>Create a group</strong> - creates a new group on SharePoint</li><li><strong>Find a user</strong> - finds or searches for a user within SharePoint</li><li><strong>Add a user to a group</strong> - adds a SharePoint user to a SharePoint group. It is important to note the difference between SharePoint users and Kianda users. SharePoint users are users of the SharePoint system. Kianda users are users of the Kianda system.</li><li><strong>Remove a user from a group</strong> - removes a SharePoint user from a SharePoint group</li><li><strong>Reset an item permission</strong>s - changes the SharePoint permissions for a given list, document or folder.</li><li><strong>Check in / out an item</strong> - checks in or out a file in SharePoint</li><li><strong>Get attachments</strong> - reads the attachments from a SharePoint list</li><li><strong>Create anonymous link</strong> - creates anonymous links for a SharePoint held file</li></ul><h3 id=whats-next--idea-iconimages18png>What&rsquo;s next <img src=/images/18.png alt="Idea icon"></h3><p>We have briefly introduced each of the ten types of <strong>SharePoint rules</strong>.

<p><input checked disabled type=checkbox> to a process (the rule will run on load)</p></li></ul><h2 id=how-to-use>How to use</h2><p>To apply this rule, first choose an item to attach the rule to and have a SharePoint data source ready where you want the user/group permissions to be reset. This data source should be a predefined data connector created with <strong>Data sources</strong> under <strong>Administration</strong>.</p><ol>
<li>
<p>Select the field to attach the rule to.</p></li><li>
<p>Click on <strong>Add a rule</strong> > <strong>SharePoint</strong> > <strong>Reset an item permissions</strong>.</p></li><li>

<p>You will be presented with three options:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Item type</strong> is used to confirm what level the permissions are to be set, be it at a site level, list level or item level. Choose from the options:
<ul>
<li><strong>Site</strong> - When selecting the site option, a <strong>Site relative url field</strong> drop-down is presented which is used to select a field from your process. The field should contain the <strong>full URL path</strong> to the site that you want to reset permissions for.</li><li><strong>List</strong> - When selecting the list option, a <strong>List relative url field</strong> drop-down is presented which is used to select a field from your process. The field should contain the <strong>full URL path</strong> to the list that you want to reset permissions for.</li><li><strong>Item</strong> - When selecting the item option, an <strong>Item id field</strong> drop-down and <strong>List title field</strong> drop-down are presented. The <strong>item id field</strong> is used to specify which Kianda field contains the <strong>Id</strong> identifier for the item you want to change permissions for. The <strong>List title field</strong> is used to specify which Kianda field contains the title of the list that stores the item.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Existing permissions</strong> allows you to either append or override the permissions of the user/group within SharePoint. Choose from the options: <strong>Add to existing</strong> or <strong>Replace existing</strong>. If it is set to <strong>Add to existing</strong> it will append the permissions and if it is set to <strong>Replace existing</strong> it will override the current permissions and only reflect the new permissions assigned via this rule.</li></ul></li><li>
<p>Under <strong>Input mapping</strong> section, click on <strong>Add mapping</strong>. This setting is used to determine what level of permissions the user/group will be assigned.
For <strong>User or Group id</strong>, select the field where the user is stored. This could be either a User Picker field or a text field.
Select the <strong>Permission level</strong> from the drop-down list.</p><p><img src=/images/permissions-rule.jpg alt="Permissions in SharePoint dialog box"></p><p>There are 10 permissions:</p><ul>

<p>To create a new Dashboard page:</p><ol>
<li>
<p>Click on <strong>Home</strong> <img src=/images/dashboard-home.jpg alt="Home button"> in the left-hand pane</p></li><li>
<p>Click on the <strong>Create a new page</strong> icon <img src=/images/dashboard-create-new-page.jpg alt="Create a new page"></p></li><li>
<p>A <strong>Create dashboard page</strong> dialog box will open, allowing you to choose from a range of options for your new dashboard page:</p><p><img src=/images/dashboard-dialog.jpg alt="Create dashboard page dialog box"></p></li></ol><p>The options in the <strong>Create dashboard page</strong> dialog box include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Title</strong> - The title of the dashboard page. You can insert whatever title you want - for example, &lsquo;Training Requests&rsquo;.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Name</strong> - This is a unique name for the dashboard.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Visible to</strong> - You can decide who will be able see the dashboard. You can select single or multiple users or Groups or a combination of the two (as shown here):</p><p><img src=/images/dashboard-visible-to.jpg alt="Dashboard page visible to"></p><p><strong>Note</strong>: <strong>Levels of Security</strong></p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Dashboard-level security</strong> can only be applied if you are an <strong>Administrator</strong> and can set the visibility of dashboards and widgets. The dashboard page-level security you are setting here - who can see the dashboard page - will override any security you set for the visibility of individual widgets on that dashboard. See <a href=/security/process-level-security#dashboard-security>Dashboard security</a> and <a href=/security/process-level-security#widget-security>Widget security</a> for more information.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Widget security</strong>: You will also be able to set security for each of the <em>individual widgets</em> that you add to the dashboard, i.e. who can view each dashboard widget.</p></li></ul></li><li>
<p><strong>Icon</strong> - You can choose an icon for your dashboard page from a drop-down list of hundreds of available icons.</p><p><img src=/images/dashboard-icon.jpg alt="Dashboard icon drop down menu"></p><p>The icon you select will appear next to the dashboard title when you click on <strong>Dashboard</strong> in the left side menu to view all of the available dashboards:</p><p><img src=/images/dashboard-icon-example.jpg alt="Dashboard page icon example"></p></li><li>

It works in a way that is similar to how a <a href=/platform/controls/layout/panel/>Panel layout control</a> is used in a form to organise the fields in a form.</p><p>To add a layout container to a Dashboard:</p><ol>
<li>
<p>Click on the <strong>Edit current page</strong> button <img src=/images/edit-current-page.jpg alt="Edit button"> to go into <strong>Edit mode</strong>.</p></li><li>
<p>Click the green <strong>Add layout container</strong> button <img src=/images/dashboard-add-layout-container.jpg alt="Dashboard Add layout container button"> at the bottom right of the dashboard page.</p></li><li>
<p>Complete the <strong>Create a layout container</strong> dialog box that opens by inserting a name and then selecting the width you want for the layout container (by selecting how wide the blue bar is):</p><p><img src=/images/dashboard-create-layout-container2.png alt="Dashboard Create a layout container dialog box"></p></li></ol><p><strong>Note</strong>:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>If you know the layout you want for your Dashboard, in terms of what widgets you want to put where, and how large you want the various widgets to be, insert layout containers <em>before</em> you start adding widgets to your dashboard page. Then, when you insert each widget, you can choose which layout container you want to assign it to when you are creating the widget.</p></li><li>
<p>Alternatively, if you aren&rsquo;t sure what widgets you are going to add or what layout you want for your dashboard, you can simply start adding widgets to your dashboard without any layout containers. Once you have added the widgets to the dashboard, you can either drag and drop the widgets to get the dashboard page layout you want or you can go back and insert layout containers and assign widgets to those containers but clicking on the <strong>Update widget settings</strong> button for each widget.</p></li><li>
<p>For example, for this existing widget, by opening the <strong>Edit widget</strong> dialog box, we can now choose to assign it to any of the four available <strong>layout containers</strong>:</p><p><img src=/images/dashboard-edit-widget-layout-container.jpg alt="Dashboard widget assign to layout container"></p><h4 id=how-to-edit-and-delete-a-layout-container>How to edit and delete a layout container</h4><p>To edit a layout container:</p><ol>

<li>
<p><a href=/platform/pages/richtext/><strong>Rich Text widget</strong></a>: The Rich Text widget can be used to display text, links or images in a dashboard.</p></li><li>
<p><strong><a href=/platform/pages/tile/>Tile widget</a></strong>: The Tile widget can be used to display a count of instances with different colour schemes. You could also add conditions to a display count - for example, you could add a condition of “Status” equals “In-progress” so that the count of process instances with a status of “In-progress” is displayed.</p></li><li>
<p><strong><a href=/platform/pages/chart/>Chart widget</a></strong>: Using a Chart widget, you could display a pie chart, bar chart or a line chart in your dashboard. These charts can be used to represent various conditions in a process.</p></li><li>
<p><a href=/platform/pages/list/><strong>List widget</strong></a>: The List widget displays the instances (individual records) of the selected process. It can also be used to connect with any other widget to display the filtered items.</p></li><li>
<p><a href=/platform/pages/filter/><strong>Filter widget</strong></a>: The Filter widget can be used to filter process instances based on a field. For example, process instances could be filtered by status.</p></li><li>
<p><a href=/platform/pages/link/><strong>Link widget</strong></a>: The Link widget can be used to add a link to a new process, dashboard or any external sources (such as SharePoint or a website).</p></li><li>
<p><a href=/platform/pages/walkthrough/><strong>Walk-through widget</strong></a>: The Walk-through widget allows you to create a walk-through of a process quickly which could be made available to a user, group or organisation.</p></li></ul><p>When you have added one or more dashboard widgets, you can move the widgets around the dashboard page using the <strong>Drag handle</strong> button.

<p>Once you are in the <strong>chart wizard</strong>, first you need to choose a type of chart you want to create. There are six option:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Pie chart</strong> - A pie chart is a circular statistical graphic, which is divided into slices to illustrate numerical proportion. In a pie chart, the arc length of each slice is proportional to the quantity it represents. To learn how to create a pie chart using Chart v2, visit <a href=/platform/pages/chartv2/#how-to-create-a-pie-chart>How to create a Pie Chart</a>.</li><li><strong>Bar chart</strong> - A bar chart or bar graph is a chart or graph that presents categorical data with rectangular bars with heights or lengths proportional to the values that they represent. The bars can be plotted vertically or horizontally. A vertical bar chart is sometimes called a column chart. To learn how to create a pie chart using Chart v2, visit <a href=/platform/pages/chartv2/#how-to-create-a-bar-chart>How to create a Bar Chart</a>.</li><li><strong>Line chart</strong> - A line chart or line graph or curve chart is a type of chart which displays information as a series of data points called &lsquo;markers&rsquo; connected by straight line segments. It is a basic type of chart common in many fields. To learn how to create a pie chart using Chart v2, visit <a href=/platform/pages/chartv2/#how-to-create-a-line-chart>How to create a Line Chart</a>.</li><li><strong>Radar chart</strong> - Radar Charts are used to compare two or more items or groups on various features or characteristics. Example: Compare two anti-depressant drugs on features such as: efficacy for severe depression, prevalence of specific side effects, interaction with alcohol, continuation of relief over time, cost to the consumer etc. To learn how to create a pie chart using Chart v2, visit <a href=/platform/pages/chartv2/#how-to-create-a-radar-chart>How to create a Radar Chart</a>.</li><li><strong>Doughnut chart</strong> - Donut charts are used to show the proportions of categorical data, with the size of each piece representing the proportion of each category. A donut chart is created using a string field and a count of features, number, or rate/ratio field. To learn how to create a pie chart using Chart v2, visit <a href=/platform/pages/chartv2/#how-to-create-a-doughnut-chart>How to create a Doughnut Chart</a>.</li><li><strong>Polar area chart</strong> - Polar area charts are similar to pie charts, but each segment has the same angle - the radius of the segment differs depending on the value. This type of chart is often useful when we want to show a comparison data similar to a pie chart, but also show a scale of values for context.

<h1 id=pg-49cd626cd2b0b2538a0362373cbf504e>6.6 - Filter widget</h1><h2 id=introduction>Introduction</h2><p>In your dashboards you can create a <strong>Filter Widget</strong>. This widget is typically used to <strong>filter</strong> data in other dashboard widgets, for example, a <a href=/platform/pages/list/>List Widget</a>, so your filter choice will influence how the list widget displays. You can use the filter to search for specific type of data within other widgets helping you to breakdown information without having to look for it manually.</p><p>You can create four types of filters:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><a href=/platform/pages/filter/#how-to-create-a-manualdatasource-filter>Manual/datasource filter</a> - this filter will allow you to search for data by selecting an option which can be entered in <strong>manually</strong> or <strong>pulled from a datasource</strong>. There are two styles of manual/datasource filters: a <strong>Dropdown</strong> or a <strong>Radio</strong> list:</p><p><img src=/images/manual-entry-filter.jpg alt="Click Edit current page button to go into Edit mode"></p></li><li>
<p><a href=/platform/pages/filter/#how-to-create-a-date-range-filter>Date range filter</a> - this filter allows you to enter <strong>two sets of dates</strong> which can be then used to filter your data based on a date input in a connected dashboard widget.</p><p><img src=/images/date-range-filter.jpg alt="Click Edit current page button to go into Edit mode"></p></li><li>
<p><a href=/platform/pages/filter/#how-to-create-free-text-filter>Free text filter</a> - this filter allows you to filter data in a connected dashboard widget by <strong>typing text freely</strong> into the search bar.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> by default you are <strong>required</strong> to connect this filter to another dashboard widget so that the filter knows which widget your are searching for data.</p><p><img src=/images/free-text-filter.jpg alt="free text filter"></p></li><li>
<p><a href=/platform/pages/filter/#how-to-create-current-user-filter>Current user filter</a> - this filter allows you to pull a <strong>profile attribute</strong> from the <strong>currently logged in user</strong> which can be then used to filter data in another dashboard widget. For example you can pull the <strong>display name</strong> attribute from the user and based on that, you could filter data in other widgets that belong to the current user. To learn more about users and profile attributes visit <a href=/platform/administration/users/#modify-profile-attributes>Modify profile attributes</a>.</p><p><img src=/images/current-user-filter.jpg alt="Current user filter"></p></li></ul><h2 id=how-to-get-started>How to get started</h2><p>To add a <strong>Filter widget</strong> to a dashboard:</p><ol>
<li>
<p>Open the relevant dashboard page. To learn how to create your first dashboard page, go to <a href=/platform/pages#how-to-create-a-dashboard-page>How to create a dashboard page</a>.</p></li><li>
<p>Click on the <strong>Edit current page</strong> button from the top dashboard menu to go into <a href=/platform/pages#dashboards-edit-mode>Dashboards Edit mode</a> (in which the <strong>Widget menu</strong>, <strong>Settings</strong> button <img src=/images/settings.png alt=Settings>, <strong>Bin/Trash</strong> button <img src=/images/bin.png alt="Bin trash button"> and <strong>Add layout container</strong> button <img src=/images/dashboard-add-layout-container.jpg alt="Dashboard Add layout container button"> are available):</p><p><img src=/images/dashboard-edit-button.jpg alt="Click Edit current page button to go into Edit mode"></p></li><li>
<p>Click on the <strong>Filter widget</strong> button in the Dashboard <strong>Widget menu</strong>.</p><p><img src=/images/dashboard-select-filter.jpg alt="Select the Rich Text button in the Dashboard Widget menu"></p></li><li>
<p>The <strong>Add widget</strong> dialog box opens with a range of options for your new <strong>Filter widget</strong>.</p><p><img src=/images/dashboard-add-widget-filter.jpg alt="Dashboard Add widget dialog box"></p><p>Choose the options you want:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Title</strong> - You can insert the title you want for your <strong>Filter widget</strong> (instead of the default title that is shown).</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Layout columns</strong> - You can choose how wide you want your <strong>Filter widget</strong> to be. You can choose from 1 to 12 columns in width by clicking on the blue bar. For example click half-way across the blue bar to create a widget that is 6 columns wide, or click to the very end of the bar to create a column that is 12 columns wide.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Colour scheme</strong> - You can choose from six colour options for the header of the widget (Navy, Green, Blue, Amber, Red or White), if you choose to display it.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Show header</strong> - You can choose whether or not you want the header of your widget to be shown when the dashboard is not in edit mode. This checkbox is selected by default, so de-select it if you don&rsquo;t want the header to be displayed.</p><p><img src=/images/header-deselected.jpg alt="show header"></p></li><li>
<p><strong>Visible to</strong> - You can choose who will be able to see the <strong>Filter widget</strong>. Select single or multiple Users or Groups, or a combination of the two. You can use the menu on the right to either filter the drop-down list by Users or Groups. To find out more about pre-defined Groups on Kianda, go to <a href=/platform/administration/users>Users & Groups</a>.</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Note - Dashboard page security</strong>: When a dashboard page is first created, the users(s)/group(s) who will be able to view the dashboard are selected in the &lsquo;<strong>Visible to</strong>&rsquo; option in the <strong>Create dashboard page</strong> dialog box (see Step 3 in <a href=/platform/pages#how-to-create-a-dashboard-page>How to create a Dashboard page</a>).</p><p>You can also edit or update this setting at any point to change who has permission to view a particular dashboard page. This higher dashboard-level security setting will take precedence over the security settings (&lsquo;Visible to&rsquo;) that are applied to the <em>individual widgets</em> within the dashboard (such as the Filter widget, in this case).</p><p>See <a href=/security/process-level-security#dashboard-security>Dashboard security</a> and <a href=/security/process-level-security#widget-security>Widget security</a> for more information.</p></li></ul></li><li>
<p><strong>Layout container</strong>: This option will only display if you have already created layout containers for your Dashboard page. Here, you can select the layout container you want to place your new <strong>Filter widget</strong> in.</p><p>A layout container is a simple way to organise, arrange and move the widgets you add to your dashboard. To learn more about layout containers, go to <a href=/platform/pages/#how-to-add-layout-containers-to-a-dashboard-page>How to add layout containers to a Dashboard page</a>.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Device visibility</strong> - You can choose what devices and types of internet connections the dashboard <strong>Filter widget</strong> will be visible on - select all the options you want from Desktop, Tablet, Mobile, Wi-Fi and Flight mode as to when the device can view the dashboards. By default, all options are selected.</p><p><img src=/images/devicevisibility.png alt="Device visibility"></p></li></ul></li><li>
<p>Click on <strong>OK</strong> when you&rsquo;ve completed the <strong>Add widget</strong> dialog box.

<p>In the Filter settings dialog, select <strong>Dropdown list</strong> or <strong>Radio list</strong> as your <strong>Filter type</strong>.</p></li><li>
<p>In the <strong>Filter options</strong> select from:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Manual entries</strong> - this option will provide you a text box in which you can specify your filter options. Each option needs to be on a separate line of the text box, see image below:</p><p><img src=/images/filter-widget-manualjpg2.png alt="manual entries filter option"></p><p>Your filter will display filter options in a different manner depending on the style you choose: <strong>Dropdown</strong> or <strong>Radio list</strong>. Dropdown list displays one additional setting (explained below).</p><p><img src=/images/dropdown-radio-lists-filter2.PNG alt="Dropdown vs Radio list filter"></p></li><li>
<p><strong>Data source</strong> - once you select this option, additional settings will appear:</p><p><img src=/images/filter-widget-datasource2.png alt="datasource entries"></p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Datasource button</strong> - this button will allow you to connect to datasource which will allow you to pull the filter options. For example, you can connect to a SharePoint list that contains all your filter options or any other datasource that has been created within your system. See <a href=/platform/connectors/>Data connectors</a> for a full list of datasources you can create.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Edit condition button</strong> - this button allows you to create a condition to pull data from the datasource, once the condition is matched the data will be pulled from the datasource. See <a href=/platform/rules/general/add-conditions/>Conditions</a> to learn more.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Display field & Value field</strong> - <strong>Display field</strong> will be the option <strong>visible</strong> to the user while the <strong>Value field</strong> will be the <strong>actual value</strong> when the option is selected. For example, if you are pulling your filter options form a SharePoint list which has multiple columns, you can select one of those columns to be displayed for the user and use another column for the value. To further extend the example, you could have the <strong>display field</strong> set to a <strong>username (title)</strong> and in the background pull the users <strong>role as the value.</strong></p><p><img src=/images/display-value-fields2.png alt="Display and value fields"></p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>
<p>If you choose to create <strong>Dropdown list</strong> filter, an additional option in the settings will be required to fill out:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Filter mode</strong> - this options will allow you to search either the beginning of a string by selecting <strong>Starts With</strong> or by selecting <strong>Contains</strong>, the filter will search if the chosen option is contained in a string.</li></ul></li><li>
<p>You can set a default value of your filter by typing one of your options into the <strong>Default value</strong> text box. This means that whenever your dashboard is loaded, the text you enter in the <strong>Default value</strong> will be automatically set as the default option.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Enable query string</strong> - check this checkbox if you wish to include a query string when filtering data. When enabled, an additional textbox will appear under the Default value textbox:</p><p><img src=/images/filter-query-strings2.png alt="filter connection"></p><p>Type the name of your parameter into the textbox provided (where the place holder says &ldquo;Parameter name&rdquo;). Check the Auto update URL checkbox to allow the URL be updated automatically when you select an option.

<p><strong>Control placeholder</strong> - if you select <strong>Dropdown list</strong> as your filter type, an additional text field will appear called Control placeholder. The text entered here will appear as the placeholder text for your dropdown filter.</p><p><img src=/images/filter-placeholder-text.png alt="Filter placeholder text"></p></li><li>
<p>Click on <strong>Add connection</strong> to connect your filter to another dashboard widget which you want to target while filtering data based on the <strong>option</strong> selected.</p><p><img src=/images/filter-connection.jpg alt="filter connection"></p><ul>
<li>
<p>Click on the <strong>Widget</strong> dropdown list to select an existing dashboard widget. Once a widget is selected a <strong>Data source filter</strong> button will appear.</p></li><li>

<h1 id=pg-d6f69692ea9e003798832d0eadc73a30>6.7 - Link widget</h1><p>A dashboard <strong>Link widget</strong> can be used to create a button link on a dashboard page that initiates a new process instance (by bringing the user straight into the first form of a particular process), links to another dashboard or links to an external website.</p><h2 id=how-to-get-started>How to get started</h2><p>To add a <strong>Link widget</strong> to a dashboard:</p><ol>
<li>
<p>Open the relevant dashboard page. To learn how to create your first dashboard page, go to <a href=/platform/pages#how-to-create-a-dashboard-page>How to create a dashboard page</a>.</p><p>For this example, we&rsquo;ll open a dashboard page called &lsquo;Annual Leave&rsquo; that currently has a <a href=/platform/pages/richtext/>Rich Text widget</a> and <a href=/platform/pages/list/>List widget</a> on it:</p><p><img src=/images/dashboard-annual-leave-example2.jpg alt="Annual Leave dashboard page example 2"></p></li><li>
<p>Click on the <strong>Edit current page</strong> button from the top dashboard menu to go into <a href=/platform/pages#dashboards-edit-mode>Dashboard Edit mode</a> (in which the <strong>Widget menu</strong>, <strong>Settings</strong> button <img src=/images/settings.png alt=Settings>, <strong>Bin/Trash</strong> button <img src=/images/bin.png alt="Bin trash button"> and <strong>Add layout container</strong> button <img src=/images/dashboard-add-layout-container.jpg alt="Dashboard Add layout container button"> are available):</p><p><img src=/images/dashboard-edit-button.jpg alt="Click Edit current page button to go into Edit mode"></p></li><li>
<p>Click on the <strong>Link widget</strong> button in the Dashboard <strong>Widget menu</strong>.</p><p><img src=/images/dashboard-select-link.jpg alt="Select the Rich Text button in the Dashboard Widget menu"></p></li><li>
<p>The <strong>Add widget</strong> dialog box opens with a range of options for your new <strong>Link widget</strong>.</p><p><img src=/images/dashboard-add-widget-link3.jpg alt="Dashboard Add widget dialog box"></p><p>Choose the options you want:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Title</strong> - You can insert the title you want for your <strong>Link widget</strong>. In our example, we&rsquo;ll call it &lsquo;Start New Process&rsquo;.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Layout columns</strong> - You can choose how wide you want your <strong>Link widget</strong> to be. You can choose from 1 to 12 columns in width by clicking on the blue bar. For example click half-way across the blue bar to create a widget that is 6 columns wide, or click to the very end of the bar to create a column that is 12 columns wide.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Custom CSS</strong> - You can add a custom CSS class name to your link widget which you can use this to style the link. To learn more on adding CSS to your platform, visit <a href=https://docs.kianda.com/low-code/global-css/>Global CSS</a>.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Colour scheme</strong> - You can choose from six colour options for the header of the widget (Navy, Green, Blue, Amber, Red or White), if you choose to display it.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Show header</strong> - You can choose whether or not you want the header of your Dashboard widget to be shown. You will need to select this checkbox if you want the Link widget header to be displayed, as it is not selected by default. If the widget header is not shown, the user will just see the link button.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Visible to</strong> - You can choose who will be able to see the <strong>Link widget</strong>. Select single or multiple Users or Groups, or a combination of the two. You can use the menu on the right to either filter the drop-down list by Users or Groups. To find out more about pre-defined Groups on Kianda, go to <a href=/platform/administration/users>Users & Groups</a>.</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Note - Dashboard page security</strong>: When a dashboard page is first created, the users(s)/group(s) who will be able to view the dashboard are selected in the &lsquo;<strong>Visible to</strong>&rsquo; option in the <strong>Create dashboard page</strong> dialog box (see Step 3 in <a href=/platform/pages#how-to-create-a-dashboard-page>How to create a Dashboard page</a>).</p><p>You can also edit or update this setting at any point to change who has permission to view a particular dashboard page. This higher dashboard-level security setting will take precedence over the security settings (&lsquo;Visible to&rsquo;) that are applied to the <em>individual widgets</em> within the dashboard (such as a Link widget, in this case).</p><p>See <a href=/security/process-level-security#dashboard-security>Dashboard security</a> and <a href=/security/process-level-security#widget-security>Widget security</a> for more information.</p></li></ul></li><li>
<p><strong>Device visibility</strong> - You can choose what devices and types of internet connections the dashboard <strong>Link widget</strong> will be visible on - select all the options you want from Desktop, Tablet, Mobile, Wi-Fi and Flight mode as to when the device can view the dashboards. By default, all options are selected.</p><p><img src=/images/devicevisibility.png alt="Device visibility"></p></li></ul></li><li>
<p>Click on <strong>OK</strong> when you&rsquo;ve completed the <strong>Add widget</strong> dialog box.</p></li><li>
<p>An <strong>Edit button links</strong> dialog box automatically opens showing the Link widget title you inserted in the <strong>Add widget</strong> dialog box:</p><p><img src=/images/dashboard-link-edit-button.jpg alt="Dashboard Link widget Edit button links dialog box"></p><p>Click on the title of the <strong>Link widget</strong> or on the <strong>Edit link</strong> button <img src=/images/dashboard-link-edit-icon.jpg alt="Dashboard Link edit link button"> to open the <strong>Edit link</strong> dialog box.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: You can click on the <strong>Add link</strong> button to add <strong>more link buttons</strong> to the Link widget. You will be able to edit the options relating to each of these <em>individual link buttons</em> by clicking on their title or on their <strong>Edit link</strong> button.</p></li><li>
<p>Select the options you want for this link button in your <strong>Link widget</strong> in the <strong>Edit link</strong> dialog box.</p><p><img src=/images/dashboard-link-edit-link-dialog2.jpg alt="Dashboard Link widget Edit link dialog box"></p><p>The options available for your <strong>Link widget</strong> include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Link text</strong> - You can insert the text you want to appear on your Link widget button.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>New Process/ Dashboard/ External</strong> - You can select whether you want the Link widget to link to a new instance of an existing Kianda process, to an existing dashboard or to an external website.</p><ul>
<li>
<p>If you select to link to a <strong>New Process</strong>:</p><ol>
<li>
<p>Click on the down arrow in the <strong>Target process</strong> field to open a drop-down list of Kianda processes.</p></li><li>
<p>Select the Kianda <strong>process</strong> that you want to open when the user clicks on the Link widget. You can type the start of a process name into the field so the drop-down list is filtered to show processes starting with that letter or word.</p><p>In our example, we will select the &lsquo;<strong>Annual leave request and approval process</strong>&rsquo; as the <strong>Target process</strong> for our new <strong>Link widget</strong>; this will mean that a new instance of the &lsquo;Annual Leave request form&rsquo; will open when the user clicks on the &lsquo;Start New Process&rsquo; Link widget button on the dashboard.</p></li><li>
<p>If you want the process to open in a pop-up dialog box without the user leaving the dashboard page, select the <strong>Show in dialog?</strong> checkbox. Otherwise, the user will be brought directly into the first form in the process that you have linked to.</p></li></ol></li><li>
<p>If you select to link to a <strong>Dashboard</strong>, the option below it changes to <strong>Target dashboard</strong>&rsquo;:</p><ol>
<li>
<p>Click on the down arrow in the <strong>Target dashboard</strong> field to open a drop-down-list of Kianda processes.</p><p><img src=/images/dashboard-link-dashboard.jpg alt="Dashboard Link widget linking to a dashboard"></p></li><li>
<p>Select the Kianda <strong>dashboard</strong> that you want to open when the user clicks on the link button.</p></li></ol></li><li>
<p>If you select to link to an <strong>External</strong> website, two options display below it - <strong>URL</strong> and &lsquo;<strong>Open in new window?</strong>&rsquo;:</p><p><img src=/images/dashboard-link-external.jpg alt="Dashboard Link widget linking to an External website"></p><ol>
<li>Insert the URL you want the user to be brought to when they click on the Link widget.</li><li>Select the &lsquo;<strong>Open in new window?</strong>&rsquo; checkbox if you want the external website to open in a new window.</li></ol></li></ul></li><li>
<p><strong>QueryString parameters</strong> - QueryString parameters can be added to the URL of the destination selected. You must define a process or dashboard as a destination to add a QueryString to the URL. To learn more about query strings, visit <a href=/platform/pages/querystrings/>Query Strings</a>.</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Append Query</strong> - there are two ways the append query works, that depends whether it redirects you to a <strong>Process</strong> or a <strong>Dashboard</strong>. When redirecting to a <strong>process</strong>, you should always check this box as the query will not automatically append to your URL. When redirecting to a dashboard and the checkbox is checked, the query will append to the existing query string. But if the checkbox is unchecked, the query string will be overwritten. This is useful when working when passing query string parameters through multiple dashboards.</p><p>As an example, let&rsquo;s say that when the user clicks on the link in the Link widget, you want the First Name field of the new Annual Leave Request form they are brought to to be pre-populated with the name &lsquo;John&rsquo;.To do this, insert the unique name of that field, as well as the value you want that field to be pre-populated with into the <strong>QueryString parameters</strong> box - in this case that will be &lsquo;<strong>firstName=John</strong>&rsquo;. [The grey text that appears in the QueryString parameters field when you open the dialog box - param1=value1 is just placeholder text.]</p><p><img src=/images/dashboard-link-query-string-parameters2.jpg alt="Dashboard Link widget query string parameters example"></p></li><li>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The unique name of a field can be found by selecting the field in the form it is in and clicking on the <strong>Edit field</strong> button. The field&rsquo;s unique name can then be copied from the <strong>Name (Unique)</strong> field.</p><p>In our example, the unique name of the &lsquo;First Name&rsquo; field in the &lsquo;Leave Request&rsquo; form is &lsquo;<strong>firstName</strong>&rsquo;:</p><p><img src=/images/field-unique-name.jpg alt="Dashboard Link widget example of field unique name"></p></li><li>
<p>For our query string parameter example to work, we now need to add an On load <strong>Set form field rule</strong> (that is, a rule that is executed when the form is opened that will run a query string to automatically populate a field in the form).</p><p>To do this, we go to Designer, and add a <strong>Set form field</strong> rule to execute when the form is loaded. In our example, the rule will set the &lsquo;First Name&rsquo; field when the form is loaded:</p><p><img src=/images/dashboard-link-query-string-set-form-field.jpg alt="Dashboard Link widget query string form on load rule example"></p><p>Once the rule has been saved, it can be viewed in the <strong>On load rules</strong> section of the right side menu when the process is opened:</p><p><img src=/images/dashboard-link-query-string-onload.jpg alt="Dashboard Link widget query string on load rule example"></p><p>To learn more about the <strong>Set form field</strong> rule, go to <a href=/platform/rules/data/set-form-field/>Set form field rule</a> or to learn more about Rules in general, see <a href=/platform/rules/>Rules</a>.</p></li></ul></li><li>
<p><strong>Link icon</strong> - You can choose the icon you want to appear on your Link widget button. Click on the down arrow and select the icon you want to use from the large number of options available.</p><p><img src=/images/dashboard-link-icon.jpg alt="Dashboard Link widget link icon"></p></li><li>
<p><strong>Text colour</strong> - You can choose the colour of the text that appears on the Link widget button. For example, if we choose orange, our Link widget button could look like this:</p><p><img src=/images/dashboard-link-button-example.jpg alt="Dashboard Link widget button example with orange text"></p></li><li>
<p><strong>Link size</strong> - You can choose the width of the Link widget button, from 1 column wide to 12 columns wide. Change the width by clicking on the blue bar.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Link visible to administrators only?</strong> - Select <strong>Yes</strong> if you want to limit the visibility of this particular link button in the Link widget to Kianda Administrators only.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Link security (optional)</strong> - You can limit visibility of this link button - the &lsquo;Start New Process&rsquo; link, in our example - in the Link widget by selecting the user(s) and/or group(s) you want to be able to see it on the dashboard.</p><p>If you choose &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; to the &lsquo;Link visible to administrators only&rsquo; option, you could then add in other users (in addition to administrators) who you want to be able to see the link button using this &lsquo;Link security&rsquo; option.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: If you have multiple button links in your <strong>Link widget</strong>, you can limit the users/groups who can view <em>each</em> of the link buttons within that Link widget.</p></li></ul></li><li>
<p>Click on the <strong>OK</strong> button when you are finished choosing the options you want for your <strong>Link widget</strong> (or click on <strong>Close</strong> to exit the <strong>Edit link</strong> dialog box without saving).</p></li><li>

<h1 id=pg-44d7388354937ca138611d1bedcc57c5>6.8 - Walk-through widget</h1><p>A dashboard <strong>Walk-through widget</strong> can be used to walk a user through the features of a dashboard or steps in a process by displaying a series of prompts.</p><p>For example, if you have a Procurement dashboard page that displays key information relating to your procurement process (using <a href=/platform/pages/chart/>Chart widgets</a>, <a href=/platform/pages/tile/>Tile widgets</a>, a <a href=/platform/pages/link/>Link widget</a> and a <a href=/platform/pages/list/>List widget</a>), it could be useful to insert a Walk-through widget that can bring a new user through the various features of the page or through steps in the procurement process.</p><h2 id=how-to-get-started>How to get started</h2><p>To add a <strong>Walk-through widget</strong> to a dashboard:</p><ol>
<li>
<p>Open the relevant dashboard page. To learn how to create your first dashboard page, go to <a href=/platform/pages#how-to-create-a-dashboard-page>How to create a dashboard page</a>.</p><p>For this example, we&rsquo;ll open a dashboard page called &lsquo;All Procurement&rsquo; that has several widgets on it displaying various information relating to a procurement process.</p><p><img src=/images/dashboard-all-procurement-example.jpg alt="Annual Leave dashboard page example 2"></p></li><li>
<p>Click on the <strong>Edit current page</strong> button from the top dashboard menu to go into <a href=/platform/pages#dashboards-edit-mode>Dashboard Edit mode</a> (in which the <strong>Widget menu</strong>, <strong>Settings</strong> button <img src=/images/settings.png alt=Settings>, <strong>Bin/Trash</strong> button <img src=/images/bin.png alt="Bin trash button"> and <strong>Add layout container</strong> button <img src=/images/dashboard-add-layout-container.jpg alt="Dashboard Add layout container button"> are available):</p><p><img src=/images/dashboard-edit-button.jpg alt="Click Edit current page button to go into Edit mode"></p></li><li>
<p>Click on the <strong>Walk-through widget</strong> button in the Dashboard <strong>Widget menu</strong>.</p><p><img src=/images/dashboard-select-walkthrough.jpg alt="Select the Rich Text button in the Dashboard Widget menu"></p></li><li>
<p>The <strong>Add widget</strong> dialog box opens with a range of options for your new <strong>Walk-through widget</strong>.</p><p><img src=/images/dashboard-add-widget-walkthrough.jpg alt="Dashboard Add widget dialog box"></p><p>Choose the options you want:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Title</strong> - You can insert the title you want for your <strong>Walk-through widget</strong> (instead of the default title shown). In our example, we&rsquo;ll call it &lsquo;Procurement Walk through&rsquo;.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Layout columns</strong> - You can choose how wide you want your <strong>Walk-through widget</strong> to be. You can choose from 1 to 12 columns in width by clicking on the blue bar. For example click half-way across the blue bar to create a widget that is 6 columns wide, or click to the very end of the bar to create a column that is 12 columns wide.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Colour scheme</strong> - You can choose from six colour options for the header of the widget (Navy, Green, Blue, Amber, Red or White), if you choose to display it.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Show header</strong> - You can choose whether or not you want the header of your Dashboard widget to be shown. This checkbox is <em>not</em> selected by default, so select it if you want the widget header to be displayed.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Visible to</strong> - You can choose who will be able to see the <strong>Walk-through widget</strong>. You can select single or multiple Users or Groups, or a combination of the two. Use the menu on the right to filter the drop-down list by Users or Groups. To find out more about pre-defined Groups on Kianda, go to <a href=/platform/administration/users>Users & Groups</a>.</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Note - Dashboard page security</strong>: When a dashboard page is first created, the users(s)/group(s) who will be able to view the dashboard are selected in the &lsquo;<strong>Visible to</strong>&rsquo; option in the <strong>Create dashboard page</strong> dialog box (see Step 3 in <a href=/platform/pages#how-to-create-a-dashboard-page>How to create a Dashboard page</a>).</p><p>You can also edit or update this setting at any point to change who has permission to view a particular dashboard page. This higher dashboard-level security setting will take precedence over the security settings (&lsquo;Visible to&rsquo;) that are applied to the <em>individual widgets</em> within the dashboard (such as the Walk-through widget, in this case).</p><p>See <a href=/security/process-level-security#dashboard-security>Dashboard security</a> and <a href=/security/process-level-security#widget-security>Widget security</a> for more information.</p></li></ul></li><li>
<p><strong>Layout container</strong>: This option will only display if you have already created layout containers for your Dashboard page. Here, you can select the layout container you want to place your new <strong>Walk-through widget</strong> in.</p><p>A layout container is a simple way to organise, arrange and move the widgets you add to your dashboard. To learn more about layout containers, go to <a href=/platform/pages#how-to-add-layout-containers-to-a-dashboard-page>How to add layout containers to a Dashboard page</a>.</p><p>In this example, we can select to place our new Walk-through widget into one of three layout containers - Top, Middle or Bottom:</p><p><img src=/images/dashboard-select-layout-container.jpg alt="Dashboard Add widget dialog box select Layout container"></p></li><li>
<p><strong>Device visibility</strong> - You can choose what devices and types of internet connections the dashboard <strong>Walk-through widget</strong> will be visible on - select all the options you want from Desktop, Tablet, Mobile, Wi-Fi and Flight mode as to when the device can view the dashboards. By default, all options are selected.</p><p><img src=/images/devicevisibility.png alt="Device visibility"></p></li></ul></li><li>
<p>Click on <strong>OK</strong> when you&rsquo;ve completed the <strong>Add widget</strong> dialog box.</p></li><li>
<p>A <strong>Walk-through steps</strong> dialog box automatically opens showing the options for the Walk-through widget:</p><p><img src=/images/dashboard-walkthrough-steps.jpg alt="Dashboard Link widget Edit button links dialog box"></p><p>Select the options you want for your <strong>Walk-through widget</strong>:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Title</strong> - You can give your Walk-through a title. In our example, we&rsquo;ll call it &lsquo;Procurement Walk-through&rsquo;.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Walk-through steps</strong> - This is where you can add all of the individual walk-through steps that you want to bring the user through.</p><p>To add your first walk-through step:</p><ol>
<li>
<p>Click on the <strong>Add step</strong> <img src=/images/dashboard-walkthrough-add-step.jpg alt="Dashboard Walkthrough widget Add step button"> button.</p></li><li>
<p>The <strong>Edit step</strong> dialog box opens, allowing you to choose from a range of options for your walk-through step.</p></li><li>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve completed the options in the <strong>Edit step</strong> dialog box, click <strong>OK</strong> to add the step to the <strong>Walk-through steps</strong> dialog box.</p><p>Repeat these three steps to add as many steps as you want to your Walk-through widget.</p><p><img src=/images/dashboard-walkthrough-edit-step-dialog.jpg alt="Dashboard Walkthrough widget Edit step dialog box"></p><p>The options for the first step in your Walk-through widget in the <strong>Edit step</strong> dialog box include:</p></li></ol><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Title</strong> - Insert a title for this walk-through step. In our example, we&rsquo;ll title our first step &lsquo;Welcome step&rsquo;.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Step type</strong> - You have a choice of three step types: <strong>Popup</strong>, <strong>App Navigation</strong> and <strong>Element click</strong>.</p><p>a. A <strong>Popup step</strong> is a pop-up dialog box containing whatever content you choose to display (including texts, links or pictures).</p><p>b. An <strong>App Navigation step</strong> brings the user to a new URL - for example, it could bring them into the first form of a process.</p><p>c. An <strong>Element click step</strong> shows the result of clicking on one of the elements in the dashboard.</p><h4 id=popup-steps><strong>Popup Steps</strong></h4><p>If you choose <strong>Popup</strong> as the step type, you can then complete the <strong>Popup content</strong> box to insert the content you want to appear in the pop-up walk-through step, including text, images or links.</p><p>You can choose from an wide array of styles and formats, including: <strong>Style</strong>, <strong>Colour</strong>, <strong>Bold</strong>, <strong>Underline</strong>, <strong>Remove font style</strong>, <strong>Font size</strong>, <strong>Font family</strong>, <strong>Unordered list</strong>, <strong>Ordered list</strong>, <strong>Paragraph</strong>, <strong>Table</strong>, <strong>Link</strong>, <strong>Picture</strong>, <strong>Code view</strong> (which allows you to switch to a code view of the step content) and <strong>Help</strong> (which displays a range of shortcut keys for different formatting options).</p><p>In our example, we will make the first step of our walk-through a Popup and will insert the content we want to appear:</p><p><img src=/images/dashboard-walkthrough-popup.jpg alt="Dashboard Walkthrough widget Popup step example"></p><h5 id=example---pop-up-step>Example - Pop-up step</h5><p>This first Popup walk-through step could look like this to the end user when they click on the <strong>Procurement Walk-through</strong> widget:</p><p><img src=/images/dashboard-walkthrough-popup-example.jpg alt="Dashboard Walkthrough widget Popup example"></p><p>The <strong>Element selector</strong> field at the bottom of the <strong>Edit step</strong> dialog box can be used if you want an element on the page to be highlighted, to show the user where they need to click.</p><p>We could add a second step in our walk-through to be another pop-up that explains that the user should click the &lsquo;<strong>New Procurement Process</strong>&rsquo; button to start a new procurement process. This time we can add an <strong>Element selector</strong> so that the button is highlighted during this step.</p><p><img src=/images/dashboard-walkthrough-element-selector.jpg alt="Dashboard Walkthrough widget element selector example"></p><h5 id=how-to-find-the-name-of-an-element-to-insert>How to find the name of an element to insert</h5><ol>
<li>
<p>Right-click on the element on the page that you want to higlight.</p><p>In our case, we right-click on the New Procurement Process link button on the dashboard (as this is what we want to highlight during this step of the walk-through).</p><p><img src=/images/dashboard-walkthrough-element-inspect.jpg alt="Dashboard Walkthrough widget Element selector inspect"></p></li><li>
<p>Click <strong>Inspect</strong>.</p></li><li>
<p>Copy the element you want to be highlighted in this walk-through step. In our case, we copy the element relating to the New Procurement Process link button:</p><p><img src=/images/dashboard-walkthrough-element-example.jpg alt="Dashboard Walkthrough widget element example"></p></li><li>
<p>Paste the name of the element into the <strong>Element selector</strong> box in the <strong>Edit step</strong> dialog box. You can choose the position of the pop-up text in relation to the element being highlighted from the <strong>Position</strong> drop-down menu.</p><h5 id=example---element-selector>Example - Element Selector</h5><p>This Popup step that includes an <strong>Element selector</strong> could look like this to the end user as the second step in the walk-through:</p><p><img src=/images/dashboard-walkthrough-element-example2.jpg alt="Dashboard Walkthrough widget Element selector example Step 2"></p></li></ol><h4 id=app-navigation-steps><strong>App Navigation steps</strong></h4><p>If you choose <strong>App Navigation</strong> as the step type, complete the <strong>Destination URL</strong> field that appears.</p><p>In our example, we will make the third step of our walk-through an App Navigation step type and will title it &lsquo;Go to Procurement form&rsquo;. The URL inserted as the Destination URL will bring the user into the first form of the Procurement process.</p><p><img src=/images/dashboard-walkthrough-app-nav.jpg alt="Dashboard Walkthrough widget App Navigation example"></p><h5 id=example---app-navigation>Example - App Navigation</h5><p>This third App Navigation step in our walk-through example could look like this to the end user - the user is brought to the website we insered as the &lsquo;<strong>Destination URL</strong>&rsquo;:</p><p><img src=/images/dashboard-walkthrough-app-nav-example.jpg alt="Dashboard Walkthrough App Navigation example"></p><h4 id=element-click-steps><strong>Element click steps</strong></h4><p>If you choose <strong>Element click</strong> as the step type, complete the <strong>Element selector</strong> field that appears - see <a href=#how-to-find-the-name-of-an-element-to-insert>How to find the name of an element to insert</a> to find out how to find the code to insert in order to show different clickable elements of the dashboard or process.</p></li></ul></li><li>
<p><strong>Auto-start</strong> - Select <strong>Yes</strong> if you want the Walk-through widget to automatically launch when a user opens the dashboard page.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>On tour end return to starting page</strong> - Select <strong>Yes</strong> if you want the user to be returned to the dashboard page once the Walk-through steps have been completed.</p><p>You can <strong>delete</strong> any of the walk-through steps you added to the <strong>Walkthrough steps</strong> dialog box by simply clicking on the <strong>Bin/Trash</strong> button to the right of the step.</p><p><img src=/images/dashboard-walkthrough-step-delete.jpg alt="Dashboard Walkthrough widget delete a walkthrough step"></p></li></ul></li><li>
<p>Once you have completed the <strong>Walk-through steps</strong> dialog box - by choosing the options and adding the steps you want - click on <strong>OK</strong> (or click on <strong>Close</strong> to exit the dialog box without saving).</p><p>The completed <strong>Walk-through steps</strong> dialog box for our simplified example could look like this:</p><p><img src=/images/dashboard-walkthrough-steps-example.jpg alt="Dashboard Walkthrough widget completed Walkthrough steps dialog box"></p></li><li>

It supports full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tables using Kianda’s <strong>Data Rules</strong>, making it possible to integrate SQL Server-driven data flows into Kianda-powered forms, dashboards, and processes. Note: table-level operations are supported; however, creating or deleting tables is <strong>not</strong> permitted.</p><hr>
<h2 id=when-to-use>When to Use</h2><p>Ideal for applications requiring dynamic access, modification, or display of data residing in SQL Server tables. You can bind table data directly to input components such as list controls.</p><hr>
<h2 id=prerequisites>Prerequisites</h2><ol>
<li>Ensure there’s at least one <strong>existing database</strong> on the SQL Server you can connect to.</li><li>Use a login that has the appropriate permissions to establish a functioning connection to the target database.</li></ol><hr>
<h2 id=configuration-steps>Configuration Steps</h2><h3 id=1-access-the-connector-setup>1. Access the Connector Setup</h3><ul>
<li>Navigate to <strong>Administration → Data sources</strong> in Kianda.</li><li>Click <strong>Add new</strong>, then select <strong>SQL Server</strong>.</li></ul><h3 id=2-fill-in-connection-details>2. Fill in Connection Details</h3><p>Provide the following information on the configuration screen:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Display name</strong>: A friendly identifier for the connector (e.g., <code>EmployeeDB Connector</code>).</li><li><strong>Server</strong>: Hostname or IP of the SQL Server (e.g., <code>localhost</code>, <code>192.168.1.5</code>).</li><li><strong>Database</strong>: Name of the target database (e.g., <code>HR_Records</code>).</li></ul><h4 id=optional-authentication-settings>Optional Authentication Settings</h4><ul>
<li><strong>Trusted connection</strong>: Use Windows authentication. When enabled, Kianda Cloud Connect is automatically used.</li><li><strong>User / Password</strong>: SQL authentication if Trusted Connection is not used (requires SQL authenticatication).</li></ul><h4 id=using-local-sql-server-with-kianda-cloud-connect>Using Local SQL Server with Kianda Cloud Connect</h4><p>If your SQL Server is running locally:</p><ul>

<h2 id=table-level-parameters>Table-Level Parameters</h2><p>Unlike other connectors, SQL Server connections don’t expose built-in parameters. Instead, when you bind a table—say, <code>Employee</code>—its <strong>columns</strong> populate dynamically into Kianda form controls such as:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Display field</strong></li><li><strong>Value field</strong></li><li><strong>Sort by</strong></li></ul><p>These options adapt to whatever columns exist in the chosen table.
<img src=/images/sql-server-employee.jpg alt="Connecting employee table to list field"></p><p>The list of parameters displayed in the the <strong>Display field</strong>, <strong>Value field</strong> and <strong>Sort by</strong> field will match the columns that we have in the <strong>Employee</strong> table, see image below:</p><p><img src=/images/sql-server-columns.jpg alt="columns in a table"></p><hr>
<h2 id=post-setup-next-steps>Post-Setup: Next Steps</h2><p>With your SQL Server connector configured and secured, you can now:</p><ul>
<li>Use Kianda’s <strong>List control</strong> to bind SQL table data to form dropdowns, lists, or tables.</li><li>Leverage Data Rules like <strong>Find item</strong>, <strong>Create item</strong>, <strong>Update item</strong>, and <strong>Delete item</strong> to integrate CRUD operations into your form-driven logic. You can map form fields as query parameters directly to form fields.</li></ul><hr>
<h2 id=best-practices-for-developers>Best Practices for Developers</h2><ul>
<li><strong>Naming strategy</strong>: Use descriptive display names to easily distinguish between multiple connectors.</li><li><strong>Auth clarity</strong>: Understand the differences between Trusted Connection and SQL authentication—choose based on your deployment model.</li><li><strong>Leverage Cloud Connect</strong> for local development access without exposing servers directly.</li><li><strong>Secure access appropriately</strong>: Use role-based restrictions to uphold data integrity.</li><li><strong>Use dynamic binding</strong>: Rely on automatic column binding to reduce manual configuration.</li><li><strong>Test thoroughly</strong>: Especially when switching between local and remote SQL Servers or between authentication methods.</li></ul></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always>

MySQL is a relational database management system (<strong>RDBMS</strong>) used to manage structured collections of data. This data can consist of anything from a simple to do list to a more complex organisation network. Using the MySQL server as your datasource, you can perform any Create, Read, Update and Delete (<strong>CRUD</strong>) operations using the <strong>Data</strong> rules provided in the Kianda platform, to learn more about data rules go to <a href=/platform/rules/data/>Data rules</a>. Using the MySQL server connector, you have access to all tables within your database from your server, keep in mind that you can perform CRUD operations on data within a <strong>table</strong> of the database, but you <strong>cannot</strong> create or delete <strong>tables themselves</strong>.</p><h2 id=when-to-use>When to use</h2><p>You can use the MySQL Server connector when you want <strong>access</strong> or <strong>modify</strong> data within a <strong>table</strong> in your MySQL server. You can connect the MySQL server connector to a <strong>List</strong> field as its datasource, meaning you can access information from a table and display the information that is stored in the table. For example if your MySQL server contains tables such as <strong>Employees</strong>, <strong>Purchases</strong> and <strong>Standing Orders</strong>, you will be able to connect the list field to one of those tables giving you CRUD access to its data.</p><p>Take a table <strong>Employees</strong> as an example, if this employee table contains data about the employees in your company such as name, phone number, email address and home address. You can <strong>create</strong> a new employee by providing necessary information, you can <strong>read</strong> (display) employee data, <strong>update</strong> employees information for example when a home address has changed and you can <strong>delete</strong> an employee from the table. Those are the CRUD operations you can perform on MySQL server through a process within Kianda.</p><h2 id=before-getting-started>Before getting started</h2><p>When establishing a connection using MySQL data connector, you are creating a connection with a <strong>Database</strong> from a server, not the <strong>server</strong> itself. Before continuing make sure that your MySQL server has a <strong>database</strong> you can connect to. A database can represent any type of data you want to access, and within this database, you need to create a <strong>table</strong> representing the actual data you will have CRUD access to. For example creating a database of your company name such as <strong>GreenITR</strong>, and within this database you can create tables to represent your <strong>Employees</strong>, <strong>Purchases</strong> and <strong>Standing Orders</strong>.</p><h2 id=how-to-get-started>How to get started</h2><ol>

These functions enable you to access a number of DocuSign&rsquo;s functionalities. You can use each DocuSign function by using the <strong>Data</strong> set of rules, to learn more about Data rules go to <a href=/platform/rules/data/>Data rules</a>. With each DocuSign function you use, data needs to be passed into the function know as <strong>payload</strong> and data is also returned, known as <strong>response</strong>. When using the Data rules, you are presented with <strong>Input mapping</strong> which is equivalent to the <strong>payload</strong>. This is used to pass data into the function, for example when you need a document signed, you need to pass in a document file to be signed, in other words, the document file you pass in is the <strong>payload</strong>. The <strong>Results mapping</strong> is equivalent to the <strong>response</strong>, this is used to populate your form fields when a DocuSign function returns data, for example <strong>status</strong> of an envelope.</p><p>Here is a list of all functions available when using the DocuSign data connector. To learn more about the <strong>payload</strong> and <strong>response</strong> for the available functions go to the <a href=https://developers.docusign.com/esign-rest-api/reference/>DocuSign API Reference</a>.</p><ul>
<li><strong>sendDocument</strong> - allows you to send one or more documents to a recipient to get them signed.</li><li><strong>sendEnvelope</strong> - allows you to send a document to a recipient using one of your DocuSign templates.</li><li><strong>listTemplates</strong> - retrieves the <strong>templateID</strong> and <strong>templateName</strong> of all templates from your DocuSign account.</li><li><strong>getEnvelope</strong> - retrieves information from an envelope using an <strong>envelopeID</strong>.</li><li><strong>getEnvelopeSummary</strong> - retrieves a summary of an envelope using an <strong>envelopeID</strong>.</li><li><strong>listEnvelopeDocuments</strong> - retrieves any documents that are contained within an envelope using an <strong>envelopeID</strong>.</li><li><strong>downloadDocument</strong> - allows you to download a specific document using a <strong>documentID</strong> from an envelope using an <strong>envelopeID</strong>.</li><li><strong>listTemplateSigners</strong> - retrieves the name, role and <strong>recipientID</strong> of all signers from a template using a <strong>templateID</strong>.</li><li><strong>getSigningUrl</strong> - retrieves a URL to a signature made on an envelope using an <strong>envelopeID</strong>.</li></ul><h3 id=example-use-case-of-docusign-function>Example use case of DocuSign function</h3><p>Take the function <strong>listTemplates</strong> as an example. The <strong>listTemplates</strong> function <strong>returns (response)</strong> an <strong>ID</strong> and the <strong>Name</strong> of all templates that you have created in your DocuSign account. To use this function effectively, you can use the <strong>Find items</strong> rule in combination with the <strong>table</strong> input. The <strong>Find items</strong> rule will access all templates and map the results into the table. For each template in your DocuSign account, the <strong>Find items</strong> rule will add a table row with the appropriate <strong>Template IDs</strong> and <strong>Template Names</strong> of each template.</p><p>To showcase the functionality explained above, we will apply the <strong>Find items</strong> rule to a <strong>button</strong>; however, it can be applied to a form field, a form or a process (the rule will be executed when the process loads). Each time we press this button, a table will be populated with a list of <strong>Template IDs</strong> and <strong>Template Names</strong> from our DocuSign account.</p><ol>

<h1 id=pg-88aef27286892357cae6014a1c05674e>7.16 - SAP connector</h1><p>One of the datasources available in Kianda is a <strong>SAP</strong> datasource. SAP is an enterprise resource planning software which allows you centralises data between all areas of your business and manage them in one SAP system.</p><p>Data in the SAP system are represented with schemas and tables. Each <strong>schema</strong> represents an <strong>area</strong> of your business and <strong>tables</strong> represent <strong>data</strong> within that business area. Using SAP as your datasource, you can perform Create, Read, Update and Delete (<strong>CRUD</strong>) operations on <strong>tables</strong> within your SAP system using the <a href=/platform/rules/data/><strong>Data rules</strong></a> provided in the Kianda platform. When using the SAP connector, keep in mind that you can perform CRUD operations on data within a <strong>tables</strong> of the system, but you <strong>cannot</strong> perform CRUD operations on <strong>tables themselves</strong>, this mean are unable to <strong>create</strong> or <strong>delete</strong> tables.</p><p>SAP connector also has the ability to use Business Application Programming Interface (<strong>BAPI</strong>) functions through Kianda. This allows you to perform particular business tasks in your SAP system by calling BAPI functions using the Data rules provided.</p><h2 id=when-to-use>When to use</h2><p>You can use the SAP connector when you want <strong>access</strong> or <strong>modify</strong> data within a standard SAP or custom <strong>table</strong> in your SAP system. You can connect the SAP connector to a <strong>List</strong> field as its datasource, meaning you can access information from a table and display the information that is stored in the table. Take a standard SAP table <strong>MARA</strong> as an example, using this table you can display information on your Kianda forms using the data within the MARA table. You can also display information of your custom made tables within your SAP system.</p><h2 id=before-getting-started>Before getting started</h2><p>You need to create a Kianda Cloud Connect connection with your device which will be used in the settings when filling out the SAP connector settings.

When you connect a SAP connector as your datasource, you can choose which <strong>Table</strong> or <strong>BAPI</strong> you want to use when performing CRUD operations. For example when connecting a SQL datasource to a <strong>List</strong> field and selecting a table you want to use, the parameters will depend on what <strong>data</strong> are present in the <strong>tables</strong>. Take standard SAP Table <strong>MARA</strong> as an example. We have an <strong>Employee</strong> table which we select when connecting a datasource to a <strong>List</strong> field, to learn how to a datasource to a list field go to <a href=/platform/controls/input/list/>List control</a>, see image below:</p><p><img src=/images/sap-mara.jpg alt="Connecting MARA table to list field"></p><p>The list of parameters displayed in the the <strong>Display field</strong>, <strong>Value field</strong> and <strong>Sort by</strong> field will match the columns that we have in the <strong>Employee</strong> table, see image below:</p><p><img src=/images/sap-mara-list-field.jpg alt="columns in a table"></p><h2 id=sap-bapi-functions>SAP BAPI functions</h2><p>In order to use <strong>BAPI functions</strong> from your SAP system <strong>effectively</strong>, the <strong><a href=/platform/rules/data/>Data rules</a></strong> within Kianda can be used. Data rules allow you to <strong>send</strong> data as well as <strong>receive</strong> it. For example if your BAPI function needs data when calling it, you can use any of the Data rules for example <strong><a href=/platform/rules/data/create-item/>Create item rule</a></strong> to send data using the <strong>input mapping</strong> section or when receiving data you can use the <strong>on success mapping</strong>.</p><p>Take a BAPI function which retrieves a list from your SAP system as an example. You can use the on success mapping to store the list in a Kianda field. If for example this BAPI function takes an argument where you want to specify how many items from the list it retrieves, you can input that information in to the input mapping section of the data rules.

<h1 id=pg-024ddac0caa22a87008e77d681ac0be4>7.17 - Active Directory Connector</h1><div class=lead>Kianda Active Directory Connector</div><p>One of the data connectors within Kianda that you can connect to is <strong>Active Directory</strong> (<strong>AD</strong>) also known as <strong>Active Directory Domain Services</strong> (<strong>AD DS</strong>). AD is a logical and hierarchical structured data store of objects which are mostly accounts. Accounts such as <strong>Users, Computers, Groups</strong> and other objects such as <strong>Printers</strong> or <strong>Group Policy Objects</strong> (GPO). For example, you can store information about user accounts within an AD such as <strong>Name, Email, Manager name, Password, Job title</strong> and <strong>Permissions</strong>.</p><p>The Kianda AD connector uses Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (<strong>LDAP</strong>) allowing users to query Active Directory libraries for example to retrieve properties for users. For more information on LDAP go to <a href=https://ldap.com/>https://ldap.com/</a> or <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol</a>.</p><h2 id=when-to-use>When to use</h2><p>Having an AD connector will allow you to access and update information that is stored in your AD database from your Kianda subscription. You will be able to use <strong>User-related</strong> AD functions which will allow you to use the connector when manipulating users within your AD. For example creating users, updating their permissions, moving them between groups or removing them from the directory. To use the AD functions, you can use the <a href=/platform/rules/data/>Data</a> rules that are predefined within Kianda.</p><h2 id=before-you-get-started>Before you get started</h2><p>Before you can create a connection with your Active Directory and your Kianda subscription, you need to</p><p>a) download <strong>Kianda Cloud Connect</strong></p><p>b) create a <strong>specific user for the connector</strong>, defined in your Active directory database</p><h4 id=kianda-cloud-connect>Kianda Cloud Connect</h4><p><strong>Kianda Cloud Connect</strong> is a piece of software that <strong>establishes a connection</strong> between your <strong>local machine</strong> and your <strong>Kianda subscription</strong>. This lightweight app will <strong>sit on your PC or server</strong> where files reside that you need to use in Kianda processes, and therefore is an <strong>on premise</strong> function .</p><p>Kianda Cloud Connect allows data to <strong>travel</strong> from your local machine to the Kianda Cloud Connect service, and then the Kianda Cloud Connect service sends data to your Kianda subscription. This data transfer works both ways depending on what operation you are performing for example <strong>Deleting</strong> a file or <strong>Creating</strong> one.</p><h4 id=user-account-for-the-connection>User account for the connection</h4><p>You must create an <strong>account in your AD service</strong> which will serve as the connector administration account for the data connector, and this account must be a global administrator in order to allow access to functions.</p><p>this account must correspond. Note that this account can only be used to manage the connector for one subscription and <strong>cannot</strong> be used in <strong>more than one Kianda subscriptions</strong> as Kianda Cloud Connect will not be able to tell which subscription you want to connect to.</p><p>To learn more about how to download and create a connection between your Kianda subscription and Kianda Cloud Connect go to <a href=/platform/connectors/kianda-cloud-connect/>Kianda Cloud Connect</a>.</p><h2 id=how-to-get-started>How to get started</h2><ol>

As mentioned earlier, we need to use the Data rules to use these functions and for this example we use the <strong>Create item</strong> rule which is available from the Data rules.</p><ol>
<li>
<p>When creating a user in Active Directory, there are some required properties that we need to provide. Those properties are a <strong>username</strong>, <strong>givenName</strong> (first name), <strong>surname</strong> (last name), <strong>email</strong> and <strong>password</strong>. There are also extra properties that can be provided by expanding a properties tab within the function:</p><p><img src=/images/ad-create-user.jpg alt="Active Directory list of functions"></p></li><li>
<p>We need to create at least five fields that will be used to provide a value as the required properties. We will use a <a href=/platform/controls/input/textbox/>text box field</a> for each one:</p><p><img src=/images/ad-fields.jpg alt="Required fields for the required properties"></p></li><li>
<p>Use the <a href=/platform/rules/data/create-item/>create item</a> rule to use the function. We need to map the text box fields to the appropriate properties as follow:</p><p><img src=/images/ad-create-user-rule.jpg alt="Mapping the required fields to create item rule"></p></li></ol><p>You can apply the create item rule to a button, for example, the submit button. This will result in a user being created in your AD whenever the submit button will be clicked.</p><h3 id=ad-use-case-example---user-synchronisation>AD Use case example - User synchronisation</h3><p>Using AD you can perform user synchronisation for user groups in Kianda. For example by creating a specific group in Kianda, we can allow Group member synchronisation for that group, by choosing the option shown in the image below with, using the AD data connector. See <a href=/platform/administration/users/#groups>Groups</a> for more details on group creation.</p><p><img src=/images/group-member-sync.jpg alt="Group member sync"></p><p>In the example above, the Kianda environment is synchronised with AD, so that any users added to or deleted from the AD database will be added to or removed from the users of the group &lsquo;Company Users&rsquo;. This kind of <strong>user synchronisation</strong> is also possible with <a href=/platform/connectors/office-365/>Office 365</a>, <a href=/platform/connectors/sharepoint/>SharePoint</a> as well as AD.</p><p>By clicking on the Filter button <img src=/images/filter-button.jpg alt="Filter button" style=zoom:80%>within Groups, an <strong>LDAP Filter</strong> can be applied. The LDAP filter is an open format that allows you to perform queries with AD. For example the query below is used to query for users in the IT department with an account that is not disabled (=2).</p><p><img src=/images/ldap-filter.jpg alt="LDAP filter example"></p><p>LDAP queries and more information on LDAP can be found in many pages such as:</p><p><a href=https://ldap.com/ldap-filters/>https://ldap.com/ldap-filters/</a></p><p><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol</a></p><p><a href=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/ldap/ldap-reference>https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/ldap/ldap-reference</a></p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always>

For example, you can store information about user accounts within an AD such as <strong>Name, Password, Job title</strong> and <strong>Permissions</strong>.</p><p>Having an AD connector will allow you to access information that is stored there within your Kianda subscription. You will be able to use <strong>User</strong> related AD functions which will allow you to use the connector when manipulating users within your AD.

Note that the <strong>user</strong> you are trying to establish a connection with <strong>must be an administrator</strong> and needs to be a <strong>unique username</strong> (email). The username you want to establish the connection with <strong><u>cannot</u></strong> be used in <strong>more than one Kianda subscriptions</strong> as Kianda Cloud Connect will not be able to tell which subscription you want to connect to.</p><p>To <strong>open</strong> Kianda Cloud Connect on your PC, open the <strong>Kianda Cloud Connect app</strong> installed on your PC, and the dialog box below will open. Note the <strong>version</strong> of Cloud Connect is visible in this dialog box, in this example 2.11.5.</p><p><img src=/images/kianda-cloud-connectv2.jpg alt="Kianda Cloud Connect"></p><ol>
<li>
<p>To establish a connection fill out the following:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Machine Identity</strong> - automatically sets the identity using the name of your local PC or server that the application has been installed on. This field is an un-editable value that <strong>cannot</strong> be changed.</li><li><strong>Kianda Username</strong> - type in the username/email of the user from your <strong>Kianda subscription</strong> you want to establish a connection with. This username must be <strong>unique across all Kianda subscriptions</strong> and must be an <strong>administrator</strong>. For example you <u><strong>cannot establish a connection</strong></u> with a <a href=mailto:connector@domain.com>connector@domain.com</a> <strong><u>if this email is used in more than one subscription</u></strong>, as Kianda Cloud Connect will not be able to determine which subscription to make a connection with. For more information on users go to <a href=/docs/platform/administration/users/>Users and groups</a>.</li><li><strong>Kianda Password</strong> - type in the password used to login, for the user in the <strong>Kianda Username</strong> field.</li><li><strong>Workspace URL</strong> - Type your workspace URL without the last forward slash.

<h1 id=pg-159da54cce37831d3fd8ec41626ce1ec>7.20.1 - REST Service and Access Token refresh</h1><h2 id=introduction>Introduction</h2><p>When creating a <strong>REST Service datasource</strong> that uses OAuth for authentication, you may want to create a &lsquo;refresh functionality&rsquo; within Kianda. This is achieved by creating a <strong>process</strong> and scheduling the process to run before the Access Token expires.</p><h2 id=how-to-get-started>How to get started</h2><h3 id=create-a-datasource>Create a datasource</h3><p>First you will need to create the <strong>datasource</strong> to connect to the application, for example, creating a <strong>REST Service</strong> with <strong>two REST Methods</strong>. The method titled <strong>Get/Refresh Auth Token</strong> will be used to refresh the Access Token with the scheduled task. For more information on how to create <strong>REST Services</strong> go to the <a href=docs/platform/connectors/rest/>REST Service page</a>.</p><p><img src=/images/sample-rest-service.gif alt="Sample REST service"></p><p>There are five parameters to pass into the request body: <code>grant_type</code>, <code>client_id</code>, <code>client_secret</code>, <code>redirect_url</code> and <code>refresh token</code>, shown below as follows:</p><p><img src=/images/refresh-token-body.jpg alt="Get/Refresh Auth Token"></p><p>These parameters need to be &lsquo;held&rsquo; in a process, see <a href=#create-a-process>Create a process</a> below.</p><h3 id=create-a-process>Create a process</h3><p>Once a datasource is created, a process is created which will contain fields for the parameters for the request body, and will hold fields from the response parameters.</p><p>As shown in the image above there are five parameters in the request body which need to be populated, and <strong>each of these parameters must correspond to a field</strong> in a process.</p><p>In the response body there are five parameters : <code>access_token</code>, <code>token_type</code>, <code>expires_in</code>, <code>refresh_token</code> and <code>created_at</code>, although only <code>access_token</code>, <code>expires_in</code> and <code>created_at</code> is needed. You can obtain the Access Token via the Developer console so details can be entered into Designer directly.</p><p>A form is created using <a href=docs/platform/application-designer/designer/>Kianda Designer</a> with <strong>textbox fields</strong> as well as a button called <strong>Refresh</strong> as follows:</p><p><img src=/images/parameters-as-fields.jpg alt="Response parameters corresponding to form fields to hold values"></p><p>Form rules are applied to fields in the form in the next section.</p><h4 id=form-rules>Form rules</h4><p>Rules are applied to both the AccessToken textbox field and the Refresh button as follows:</p><ol>
<li>
<p>On the <strong>Refresh button</strong> add a <strong>Data rule</strong> > <strong>Set Form Field</strong> which will be used to clear the AccessToken field. Give the rule a title for example &lsquo;Clear Access Token&rsquo; and map a &lsquo;blank&rsquo; value to the Access Token field by &lsquo;pressing space bar key&rsquo; as shown below:</p><p><img src=/images/clear-access-token.jpg alt="Set form field rule to Clear Access Token field"></p></li><li>
<p>On the <strong>Refresh button</strong> add a <strong>Data rule</strong> > <strong>Create item</strong> which will be used to invoke the REST Service to get a new token and map the response back to the process.</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Within the rule, click on <strong>Select data source</strong> and select the datasource created within <a href=#create-a-datasource>Create a datasource</a>, in the example on this page, &lsquo;Sample Rest Service&rsquo;.</p></li><li>
<p>Then select the &lsquo;Get/Refresh Auth Token REST Method&rsquo; as shown below.</p><p><img src=/images/select-rest-method.jpg alt="Selecting Get/Refresh Auth Token REST Method in Sample REST Service data source"></p></li><li>
<p>Under <strong>Input mapping</strong> map the values from the process into the request body. The left-hand column, <strong>Form field or text</strong>, represents the fields within the process or hard coded values. The right-hand column, <strong>Data source field</strong>, represents the values within the <strong>REST Service,</strong> be it the request header, request body, response header or response body**.** For example choose the form field such as grant_type and then in the data source field drill down to the value you want from the REST method.</p><img src=/images/select-data-source-field.jpg alt="Selecting data source field" style=zoom:80%>
</li><li>
<p>In addition to the parameters defined with the <strong>REST Service</strong> the <strong>urlPath</strong> can be defined in the process and passed into the datasource. Map the form fields <code>grant_type</code>, <code>client_id</code>, <code>client_secret</code>, <code>redirect_url</code> and <code>refresh token</code>, into the form fields.</p><img src=/images/get-new-token.jpg alt="Create item rule to get a new token and map response back to a Kianda process" style=zoom:80%>
</li><li>
<p>The <strong>On Success Mapping section</strong> is used to <strong>map the result from the API call back into the process</strong>. Map <code>access_token</code>, <code>refresh_token</code>, <code>expires_in</code> and <code>created_at</code>, to the relative form fields.</p></li></ul></li><li>
<p>In addition to the parameters defined with the <strong>REST Service</strong> the <strong>urlPath</strong> can be defined in the process and passed into the datasource.</p></li><li>
<p>On the <strong>Refresh button</strong> add a <strong>Form action rule</strong> > <strong>Save form</strong> so that the details from the process are saved to the system database. The rule order then is as follows:</p></li></ol><p>Finally; run the Process in preview mode, ensure the details you want to pass into the <strong>REST Service</strong> are correct and save the process. Take note of the Process ID as this will be needed for setting up the Scheduled Task</p><p><strong>Create the Scheduled Task</strong></p><p>The final step will be to create the scheduled task that will run before the refresh token expires. Navigate to the <strong>Scheduled tasks</strong> within the <strong>Administration</strong> section in the site. Click on the <strong>Schedule a task</strong> button and fill in the dialog box.</p><ol>
<li>
<p>Enter a name for the task in the <strong>Task Name</strong> field.</p></li><li>
<p>Under <strong>Schedule</strong> select the <strong>Minutes</strong> option. In the <strong>Every</strong> <strong>Minutes</strong> field enter a numerical value. For example, if the Access Token expires every 60 minutes, enter 55, meaning the schedule will run every 55 minutes.</p></li><li>
<p>Leave the <strong>Expire</strong> checkbox blank as this schedule should never stop.</p></li><li>
<p>Under <strong>Process Design</strong> select the name of the process that you created in the step above. This will expose a new field called <strong>Select the field or rule to trigger on schedule.</strong></p></li><li>
<p>In <strong>Process ID</strong> enter the ID of the process that you created in preview mode.</p></li><li>
<p>In <strong>Select the field or rule to trigger on schedule</strong> select the <strong>Refresh</strong> button.</p></li><li>
<p>Click <strong>OK</strong> to save.</p></li></ol><p>The Schedule is now set up and will refresh the access token as frequently as the time entered in the minutes field.</p><p><strong>Next Steps</strong></p><p>The Schedule is now set up and will refresh the access token as frequently as the time entered in the minutes field. This will run indefinitely until a user chooses to delete the schedule.</p><p>The datasource is now available to used and the Access Token is being kept current. The Access Token can be pulled into different <strong>Processes</strong> and used to send further <strong>REST APIs</strong>.

<h1 id=pg-ad4bf19c8ee7b9e9b2196b1d44f5cf5c>8.3 - Secure Data Access</h1><h2 id=introduction>Introduction</h2><p>Access to the B2B Portal is controlled through standard user and group creation, dashboard security and through how the Shared Processes and Dashboards are defined.</p><h2 id=when-to-use>When to use</h2><p>B2B Portals are a means of connecting your clients to your Kianda subscription through their own subscription. This provides a means of allowing your clients to interface with processes you have already created, be it through updating existing processes, deleting processes or creating processes. Access to the B2B Portal can be controlled by your own administrator and each B2B portal can have multiple users for your clients.</p><h2 id=how-to-get-started>How to get started</h2><p>To share data with B2B portal users, there are a number of steps involved starting with:</p><p>a) <a href=#create-users-and-groups-for-the-B2B-portal>Creating users and groups</a></p><p>b) <a href=#create-dashboards-to-share>Create dashboards to share</a></p><p>c) <a href=#create-shared-processes-and-attach-dashboards-to-share>Create shared processes and attach dashboards to share</a></p><p>These steps are covered within the headings below.

<li>
<p>To begin create <strong>Users</strong> and <strong>Groups</strong> for the B2B portal. If you are an <strong>administrator,</strong> navigate to the <strong>Administration</strong> section in the left-hand side menu and click on <strong>Users</strong>.</p></li><li>
<p>Within this page you will be able to view all existing <strong>Users</strong> and <strong>Groups</strong> in the portal. In the left-hand side, under <strong>Users</strong> you can see user names, emails, role and if they are active or not. All existing <strong>Groups</strong> can be seen in the right-hand side of the screen. Here you can see group names and the number of members.</p><p><img src=/images/user-main-view.jpg alt="Users main view"></p></li><li>
<p>For full details on how to create, edit and delete users and groups go to <a href=/platform/administration/users/>Users</a>.</p></li></ol><h3 id=create-dashboards-to-share>Create dashboards to share</h3><ol>
<li>Within your own portal you may then wish to create <strong>Dashboards</strong> to share. Dashboards provide a convenient way to gain insights into how your business processes are performing. They offer easy reporting, permissions management, quick build, condition-based filtering amongst other features. For details on how to get started with dashboards go to <a href=/platform/pages/>Dashboards</a>.</li></ol><h3 id=create-shared-processes-and-attach-dashboards-to-share>Create shared processes and attach dashboards to share</h3><ol>
<li>
<p>When the dashboard that you want to share within your <strong>B2B portal</strong> has been created, then you can control access by two means: a) Using the <strong>Shared Processes</strong> feature within <strong>Invite partner</strong> within <strong>Administration</strong> and b) within the B2B portal itself.</p></li><li>
<p>To implement a) go to <strong>Administration</strong> > <strong>Invite partner</strong> and within the <strong>Shared processes</strong> section, click on <strong>Share a process</strong>.</p></li><li>
<p>Type in a <strong>Title</strong> and <strong>Instructions for partner</strong>, click on the <strong>plus symbol</strong> <img src=/images/add-process.jpg alt="Add shared process"> to add a selected process design to share.</p></li><li>
<p>Then click on the dropdown list to search for a process to share.</p></li><li>
<p>Click on the <strong>tick symbol</strong> <img src=/images/edit-selected-process.jpg alt="Edit selected shared  process"> to add the selected shared process.</p></li><li>
<p>Click on the <strong>Add partner group</strong> button to add a group from step 3 and click on <strong>Dashboard template</strong> to add the desired Dashboard (from step 4) to share. Security can be set on this dashboard so that only a defined group can see the dashboard - click on the field under <strong>Dashboard security</strong> to add in a named &lsquo;partner group&rsquo; to enable access to this group only.</p><p><img src=/images/edit-shared-process.jpg alt="Edit Shared Process dialog box"></p></li><li>
<p>Add as many shared dashboards and partner groups as needed using the previous instructions. In addition the level of access for each shared process can be controlled through system settings. Click on the on the <strong>tick symbol</strong> <img src=/images/edit-selected-process.jpg alt="Edit selected shared  process"> to change the shared processes details, and then click on the <strong>Cog/Settings</strong> button <img src=/images/cog-shared-process.jpg alt="Edit selected shared process properties"> and edit the details within the <strong>Process properties</strong> dialog box, for example as shown for a Training Request process below.</p><p><img src=/images/change-selected-prop.jpg alt="Edit selected shared process properties"></p></li><li>
<p>Within the <strong>Process properties</strong> dialog box you can check radio buttons for:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Allow partner to create a new process instance</strong> - choose from <strong>Yes</strong> or <strong>No</strong>. If you choose <strong>Yes</strong>, then you are allowing invited partner(s) to create new process instances from the chosen shared process design. A field <strong>Partner user group allowed to create new instances</strong> appears, where you can define the group(s) in the partner organisation, that can create these new process instances. If you leave the field blank, then anyone in the partner organisation can create process instances.</li><li><strong>Allow partner delete a process instance</strong> - choose from <strong>Yes</strong> or <strong>No</strong>. If you choose <strong>Yes</strong>, then you are allowing invited partner(s) to delete new process instances from the chosen shared process design.</li><li><strong>Partner user group allowed to create new instances</strong>- choose from the <strong>Partner user groups</strong> that you created previously. By selecting a group here this dictates who can enter the process. Thus, defining a sub set of your B2B Portal users which can interact with that specific process.</li><li><strong>Partner process form visibility mode</strong> - choose from <strong>Assigned</strong> or <strong>All forms</strong>. If you choose <strong>Assigned</strong>, then the invited partner(s) can view only assigned form versus all forms, if <strong>All forms</strong> is chosen.</li></ul></li><li>

If a user license is <strong>issued</strong>, the total number of licenses will <strong>decrease</strong>, and if a user license is <strong>revoked</strong>, the total number of licenses will <strong>increase</strong>. If there are no more remaining licenses, new users will be deactivated. You can get more licenses by deactivating users or purchasing additional licenses.</p><p><img src=/images/licenses.png alt="Licenses image"></p><h3 id=view-and-edit-existing-user-details>View and edit existing user details</h3><ol>

<h1 id=pg-86a8a71f5dde15f7f9c0bd546b6a37c9>10 - Document generation</h1><p><strong>Document generation</strong> refers to the use of Kianda Add-ins for Word, and also Excel, that you can use to <strong>generate reports</strong> within Kianda processes and <strong>populate</strong> the reports with <strong>data captured</strong> within each process instance. This could be useful, for example, for inspection reports where a report template can be used to show the information the engineer input to a <strong>Kianda form</strong> during his inspection. Each time an inspection is performed, a report is generated based on a Word template and the report shows the relevant information that was captured during that particular inspection.</p><p><em>Microsoft Word template with Kianda form fields</em></p><p><img src=/images/word-template.jpg alt="MS Word template containing Kianda form fields"></p><p>In the example above, a report will generate data pulled from a Kianda process instance (record) that contains the date, company and location data within an ‘Inspection Form’ and a ‘Request Form’. To create this kind of template, you can use a <strong>Kianda Add-in</strong> in Word to link your document to your Kianda process.</p><h2 id=installing-kianda-add-in-to-word-or-excel>Installing Kianda Add-in to Word or Excel</h2><p>The example below steps through how to install the Kianda Add-in for Word, however the same steps apply to get started with the Kianda Add-in for Excel.</p><ol>
<li>
<p>Create a template outline in Microsoft Word.</p></li><li>
<p>Click on the <strong>Insert</strong> tab > <strong>Get Add-ins</strong></p><p><img src=/images/word-get-add-in.jpg alt="Get add-ins"></p></li><li>
<p>Search for <strong>Kianda</strong>.</p></li><li>
<p>Click on <strong>Add</strong>, then <strong>Continue</strong> and click on the <strong>Home</strong> tab. The <strong>Show Kianda Taskpane</strong> should be added to your ribbon.</p></li><li>
<p>On the right-hand side of the Home tab, click on the <strong>Kianda Add-in</strong>.</p><p><img src=/images/word-kianda-add-in-button.jpg alt="Kianda button in word"></p></li><li>
<p>In the Kianda pane log in using your Kianda <strong>username</strong> and <strong>password</strong>.</p><p><img src=/images/kianda-add-in-login.jpg alt="Kianda add-in login"></p></li><li>
<p>From the drop-down list under <strong>Login to Kianda</strong>, select your Kianda subscription and press <strong>Continue</strong>. Note that all of your subscriptions will be available in the drop-down. Make sure to select the correct one when creating you template.</p><p><img src=/images/kianda-add-in-select.jpg alt="Kianda add-in subscription selection"></p></li></ol><h2 id=before-you-begin-using-the-kianda-add-in-for-word-or-excel>Before you begin using the Kianda add-in for Word or Excel</h2><p>When you want to use Kianda add-in for both a Word or Excel template, you need to have created a process with one or more forms. The forms need to have different types of fields within them, for example a text box field or a table field. Those fields are used to create <strong>smart tags</strong> using the Kianda add-in within a Word or Excel template. Smart tags are created when a field is selected from a process using the Kianda add-in task pane, and then inserted into the document. See the image below for a presentation of a smart tag in Excel:</p><p><img src=/images/excel-add-in-smart-tag.jpg alt="Smart tag explanation"></p><p>Before you get started, you also need to have the outline of a template ready so that you can import data from your process by using the smart tags. For each instance of a process the smart tags will pull values from that a specific process instance, but the outline of the template will stay the same. For example, if you create a Health & Safety checklist process, the outline of the checklist is always the same but the values may differ for each time the checklist is filled out. A template outline represents the generic outline of what data will be needed in the final generated document, for example, you need the date, the company, location and relevant checks that need to be performed. See image below for an example of a template outline:</p><h6 id=heading><a href></a></h6><p><img src=/images/doc-gen-template-outline.jpg alt="Template outline"></p><p>We have briefly introduced the concept of document generation in Kianda.

This could be useful, for example, when performing a health & safety check on a building site. A template can be used by an inspector to have a <strong>generic outline</strong> of what needs to be completed when preforming the check. Each time a check is performed, the generated report may contain different data. This data is <strong>pulled</strong> directly from the each <strong>individual check</strong> when performed by an inspector.</p><h2 id=before-you-get-started>Before you get started</h2><p>In advance of creating a template, you need to install Kianda add-in for word.

This could be useful, for example, when working with a lot of table data within Kianda. The add-in will <strong>automatically</strong> populate excel cells with the data from a table within your process. Each time value changes inside of a table, those values will be reflected in the Excel workbook every time you generate a new workbook.</p><h2 id=before-you-get-started>Before you get started</h2><p>In advance of creating a template, you need to install Kianda add-in for word. Go to <a href=/platform/document-generation/#installing-kianda-add-in-to-word-or-excel>Installing Kianda add-in for Word or Excel</a> and follow the steps of installation. You also need to create a template outline before starting, to learn more about what a template outline is, go to <a href=/platform/document-generation/#heading>template outline</a>.</p><h3 id=using-the-kianda-add-in-for-excel>Using the Kianda Add-in for Excel</h3><ol>
